hi good morning everyone and thank you

for the opportunity to

share a few words i represent

much of the west of hudson mta service

area

much of rockland and orange counties and

that is what i want to focus my remarks

on today um i fully understand and

appreciate

that the goal of congestion pricing is

to certainly disincentivize uh driving

into the business district and

secondarily incentivize uh public

transit into the business district but

as hopefully many of you within the mta

and the review board are aware

there is simply inadequate public

transit from west of hudson into the

business district and so there there

really is very little opportunity for my

constituents to migrate from driving if

they do that now to train service and

let me try and paint the picture very

quickly as to what i mean

harriman which is by considerable margin

the most heavily trafficked uh train

station in orange county

offers 13

rides 13 trains from harriman to new

york city during weekdays daily 13.

in fact the largest gap

between trains during the day and this

is in the late afternoon mid late

afternoon six hours and 34 minutes in

between two trains that someone would

have to wait what if you work the

afternoon or evening shift there are

literally zero trains for you to get

into new york city comparatively if you

drive an hour north east of hudson or an

hour east

on long island a peak skill for example

28 trains daily bay shore long island 25

trains daily harriman is 13.

by the way west of hudson we don't even

have a train one train to new york city

we have trains to secaucus we do not

have a one-seat ride we have to transfer

in new jersey before getting into penn

station

so i implore the review board to

please consider a dollar for dollar

credit

where drivers from orange and rocklin

counties have to drive into manhattan

travel priority business districts over

the george washington bridge or the

lincoln tunnel provide that credit for

whatever congestion pricing scheme that

you come up with thank you for your

consideration for our west of hudson

presidents

===

good evening good afternoon everyone

thank you for allowing me the

opportunity to speak

as the senator just alluded to i

represent rocklin county on the western

side of the hudson river

and rocklin county residents have been

consistently short-changed by the mta

for years

we spend over 50 million more in taxes

to the mta than services we receive

and just last year the mta threatened to

eliminate rail service to rockland

county and orange county

completely it's absolutely unacceptable

and when you look at the situation with

congestion pricing the simple truth is

it is a regressive tax

on middle-income and low-income families

who are

struggling to make ends meet

in our high-taxed state rockland county

residents pay the second highest

property taxes in america

and so

congestion pricing

will severely hurt

those families

who are traveling to new york city

to uh to work and to provide for their

families

uh we have seen express rail service cut

in rockland county

uh we have seen

uh

tolls increase on the tappan zee and

george washington bridges

and so

at this point to implement a congestion

pricing program

which was really intended to help the

mta fund

uh it's it's expensive expenses and help

the mta

uh make up for its failed mismanagement

of the mta system

uh it's unacceptable and so i oppose

congestion pricing

and i do not believe that we should

continue forward and i call on the

governor to

end it immediately

and come up with a new plan to fund the

mta in addition to all the federal

funding that it has received over the

last year thank you

===

good morning

my name is eric shone

i represent yonkers residents who have

questions about this plan

in the middle of a pandemic you're

talking about congestion pricing people

where i live in yonkers have no

convenient 24-hour a day

public transit options into new york

city

people are afraid due to covid to ride

public transit many like me

go into new york for cultural

experiences at night like i am this

evening and weekends no congestion then

there should be no congestion pricing

you've provided no details on pricing i

think that's disgraceful

uh you should uh concentrate on using

tow money we paid to fix the potholes

that destroy our cars

i'm a little confused if i take the

henry hudson parkway

to the west side highway

to go into manhattan am i going to be

affected by congestion pricing

it seems to me that you talked about the

fdr drive being the only

uh avenue that is going to be

involved with this am i going to be

affected if i take the henry hudson

parkway into the west side highway

uh you folks have got to start thinking

fix

not tax

two minutes to comment

i think that's really really unrealistic

and who are you you really who are you

kidding

opening up new york is that what we're

trying to do then you should be having

live public hearings

not having public hearings

on

zoom i thank you very much

and i wish you all the best

good morning

my name is darwin kung i am the climate

and health policy manager for tri-state

transportation campaign an advocacy and

policy organization fighting for

sustainable mobility in new york new

jersey and connecticut

i'm also born was born and raised in

rockland county and i've lived in

manhattan while maintaining my mph from

colombia i know how card dependent our

suburbs are i know how congested and

crowded lower manhattan can be as

someone who has both driven and walked

and taken public transit throughout the

city

despite being a product of car centric

suburbia i support this congestion

pricing plan as a new yorker who sees

the overall benefits to our region my

reasons are as follows congestion

pricing reduces congestion in the

central business district this reduction

in congestion will speed up buses and

public transit options that travel into

the central business district such as

the rock and coach buses

less traffic also means less noise and

pedestrian and vehicle conflicts which

is crucial for realizing vision zero and

creating a safer and walkable city

congestion pricing also reduces traffic

emissions fewer emissions means improved

air quality and health from fewer

pollutants from such as pm 2.5 ozone and

black carbon

it also reduces carbon emissions

transportation accounts for the largest

share of carbon emissions in new york

state

it also helps fund our desperately

needed alternatives to driving such as

metro north in rockland alone we have

four stations that serves our county

funding must help and improve

desperately need service for our region

to give us viable alternatives to

driving

we're in a climate emergency and our

region is faced with a challenge of

reducing greenhouse gas emissions

by 20

20 2050.

from super certain standing to ida in

2021 we've seen the effects of climate

the climate crisis in our region we have

to act now to reduce carbon emissions

from the transportation sector

to secure our own future not only does

congestion pricing protect our

environment and public health it

incentivizes and enables improved

service for transit riders we have

tri-state has been fighting for

transition pricing for well over a

decade it's proven to reduce congestion

it's proven to improve health we must

use this opportunity to expand access

for public transit in the hudson valley

thank you

===

good morning my name is david garden i'm

a resident of westchester county and

every weekday i take a metronome train

to midtown in manhattan including today

where everybody was messed up why work

as a senior vice president rxr one of

the largest owners operators and

developers of real estate in the region

i'm here to speak in strong support of

congestion pricing i first want to take

a moment to remind everyone about the

summer of 2017.

that summer our subways experienced over

80 000 delays a month we had the worst

on-time performance in the world and it

became faster to walk than ride a bus in

midtown manhattan

fortunately sound management stabilized

our system but the need to invest has

only grown and if we have learned

anything from that summer it is that the

status quo of fair increases and hoping

to stave off another summer of hell is a

recipe for disaster instead we need a

long-term solution and that solution is

congestion pricing now some may wonder

if the mta can recover from the

structural shifts caused by cobit 19

given that half of its ridership has yet

to return

well in june new york city saw the

highest total residential leases signed

since 2008.

luxury sales have already exceeded the

previous record of 2014 and google one

of the most successful companies in the

world just announced it was making

another multi-billion dollar commitment

to new york city the question isn't

whether new york will come back but when

and will be ready

finally with a little over two percent

of westchester county residents

community by car the overwhelming

majority of us here in westchester would

benefit from congestion pricing

if you still want to drive into the city

then your luck congestion pricing will

mean less traffic if you decide to drive

we all have a role to play that is the

burden and responsibility for citizens

citizenship

in this region that means there should

be little to no exemptions to the

program with exceptions made for

low-income residents

make no mistake if we fail to move

forward in modernizing our system not

only will be jeopardizing the strongest

regional economy in the country but

we'll also be placing a tax on our

children

let's investigate please conclude your

remarks

with the with congestion pricing program

thank you

hi

my name is anshul gupta and i live in

valhalla new york with my wife and son

i'm reading this statement on behalf of

my wife rinku who's currently at work

i'm a financial manager in a

not-for-profit organization in new york

city since i drive for the city two to

three times a week the congestion toll

will increase the cost of my compute

however i am still commenting in favor

of congestion pricing

if you've seen or heard about the latest

ipcc report on climate change you

already know that we are in a climate

crisis and we must act accordingly

we procrastinated too long and we must

wake up for the lost time

recent historic flooding in new york in

new jersey with hurricane ida within 10

years of sandy and irene shows that

while the most catastrophic effects of

climate change

may not start for another generation

which by the way is our children and

grandchildren

we can see for ourselves that the

climate scientists were right all along

in fact the worst case scenario of the

prediction seems to be unfolding

the congestion pricing will directly

reduce emissions due to reduced traffic

and will also fund public transportation

improvements to indirectly reduce the

number of private vehicles even outside

its implementation so

i believe that the small cost is well

worth the immediate and long-term

benefits to new york city which is in

the crosshairs of sea level rise from

global warming

the earth's atmosphere is warming from

the cumulative carbon emissions in the

20th and 21st century

the united states has had the biggest

share of these cumulative emissions

double than china's and many times more

than other countries therefore the u.s

must lead the worldwide efforts to

reduce emissions although it hasn't done

so far

western europe dramatically reduced its

emissions over the last decade and its

economy is doing just fine london and

singapore have congestion pricing and

those cities are thriving therefore i'm

confident the resilient and resourceful

people who live and work here will

quickly adapt to the change and new york

will be a cleaner healthier safer and

more vibrant city with it thank you

===

uh yes can you hear me

we can okay yes good morning uh my name

is javi alvarado i am a resident of

dobbs ferry here in westchester um i am

for the congestion pricing but i would

like to address a few concerns um for

the board this morning so my first off i

am as an essential worker

i provide physical security at a federal

office building in midtown manhattan and

what the mta doesn't realize is that not

everybody in the new york city workforce

is a nine-to-five employee i am a an

evening worker who goes into work around

3 p.m in the afternoon and i get out

approximately around midnight

the mta focuses so much on

trains on the metro north line from six

to nine and from four to seven

the issue that i have uh with the

conduction pricing is if they want me to

take the train into the city for work

i would like to see an increase in late

night service for example at 11 p.m uh

you can take two trains leaving uh

leaving grand central but after midnight

it's one train an hour and then after 1

50 there are no more trains uh leaving

grand central back into the suburbs and

in my situation sometimes during

inclement weather

we need to have

somebody there

24 hours a day in our building and so if

one of my fellow co-workers can't make

it in then i have to stay over and the

issue with that is after 4 a.m i have no

way of getting home so the

alternative will mean for me to pay 90

for a taxi to get home

i also want to address um climate

resiliency so as we saw a couple weeks

back during tropical storm ida the metro

norfolk line especially the hudson line

was out of service for four days

i want to know what the mta is going to

do to address that issue in the near

future and i'd also like to see

more transparency with the budget

when

you know if and when this takes effect

thank you

hi my name is chris hayward and i work

in the cbd and live in brooklyn

many suburban commuters are against

congestion pricing because they do not

want to pay the true cost associated

with their life decisions by working in

the cbd and living outside the city

they're able to reap the benefits of a

the financial benefits of a major

metropolis while enjoying the perks of a

suburban lifestyle i.e living in a large

home with a yard at a relatively low

cost compared to the city

for reference in most areas outside the

city i could easily buy a mansion on a

golf course or a lake

for the cost of my two-bedroom apartment

in brooklyn instead i chose to raise two

children in a modest size apartment

a significant reason underlying this

decision is so that i could commute to

my workplace in the cbd

via train or bike rather than driving

congestion pricing should reflect the

true cost of driving in manhattan the

proposed change simply to propose charge

simply doesn't reflect the cost of

driving on everyone else what economists

call negative externalities

in 2009 transportation economist charles

komenov found the average car driven

into manhattan south of 60 street causes

a total of 3.26 hours of delays to

everybody else

driving in new york city is generally

speaking a selfish decision that

punishes other people more than yourself

with an average of two people in each

car com now found that driving a car

into manhattan on a weekday causes about

160 dollars of negative externalities to

everybody else trying to use the road

and that's why the proposed charge isn't

enough

driving a private car into manhattan

should cost a hundred dollars per trip

perhaps offering reduced pricing for

incomes below one hundred thousand

dollars which would address the largely

species claims that congestion pricing

will hurt working-class families

congestion pricing has demonstrated

success in 2003 london introduced

congestion pricing when entering central

london of approximately fifteen dollars

it worked exactly as intended the

initial reduction in traffic was huge

with fifteen to twenty percent boost in

bus speeds and thirty percent reductions

in congestion as the city reinvested the

revenue from congestion fees back into

transportation improvements including

massive bicycle super highway projects

bus lanes and general roadway repairs

traffic for cars got worse again

biking is safer quicker and more popular

than ever buses are much faster i urge

you to implement congestion pricing with

a cost that reflects the true

externalities as soon as possible thank

you

===

hi good morning um thank you for

allowing me to speak i just want to say

that i am against the congestive pricing

and one of the main reasons why i'm i'm

concerned and against it

is not really the environmental impact

but the cost and how it's going to be

determined

and where the tolls will be because it's

so unclear as to where these tolls will

come in at um they said

the low 60th street i don't know what

that means so is there any clear

designations on where these tolls will

be set up so commuters will know

um in addition i also bike in addition

to drive by

but i live in queens and i already have

to pay a toll to get to the bronx so

westchester i work in yonkers so every

day i'm faced with those tolls and now

and although we

[Music]

certain things oftentimes tolls don't

they

are created

to do

thank you
