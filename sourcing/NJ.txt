good morning we can hear you okay great

good morning i'm congressman josh

gottheimer i'm very proud to represent

new jersey's fifth congressional

district and i'm here today to fight

back against new york's proposed

congestion tax under this proposed

congestion tax when new jersey commuters

drive across the gw bridge and into

midtown they'll get whacked not only

with the gwb 16 a day tall which is

ridiculous but now an additional 15

congestion tax when they drive south of

60th street that's up to 31 a day or

more in total for a nurse just to drive

to work in new york city or to see

family at a time when we all need a

comeback even more concerning unlike the

shared port authority resources from the

tolls which help both our states every

nickel of this new congestion tax will

go solely to the mta not a cent will be

shared with a path or new jersey transit

to help new jersey that's unacceptable

letting a new regressive tax on jersey

commuters who already pay a fortune to

get into the city and millions in new

york state taxes plus all of the

resources here in washington that we've

sent to new york city during the covid

crisis that's no way to make this region

stronger instead this is simply an

attempt to mooch off of new jersey also

as the mta chief financial officer said

in june the mta does not need

the congestion pricing proceeds right

now

i strongly urge you to withdraw this

proposal and work together with us

toward a more cooperative better

solution for everyone when we work

together new jersey and new york are a

tough combination to be but right now

for my district and for all new jersey

commuters and all those who need to

visit family in new york i have no other

choice but to fight back thank you so

much for having me today

===

hi

my name is robert green and i live in

the cbd

if you look up cbd and google you find

nothing but weed shops

that's because there is no such thing as

the central business district a place

where 1.3 million people live as is true

below 60th street on the island of

manhattan is anything but

it's a central living district and it

should be described as such i know that

the three generations of my family that

live here retired working and in school

deserve safe walking

safe biking and clean air just like

wherever you are coming from to drive

into the cld

that's right the cld remember that

in fact most people who drive here have

yards or areas for their kids to play in

by their house here

in the cld the city is our backyard and

yet people in cars and trucks think that

they should just be able to stomp all

over our yard and pay nothing for the

privilege please

cars should be seen as guests in the cld

and their use and abuse must be lessened

past congestion pricing with no

exemptions as soon as you can so that me

my kids and my parents and the

1.299997 million other people can all

walk bike and breathe easier thank you

===

hello uh my name is richard geraldi i

live in jersey city and before the

pandemic i commuted daily into manhattan

uh while i do own a car i primarily get

around the region by walking biking and

riding the path in subway

i'm here today to express my unequivocal

support for the central business

district totaling program in reality new

york city and the entire metro area need

to do much more than implement

congestion pricing to make the region

more livable for all of its residents

but the program is an important step and

the city state and federal government

should do everything in their power to

expedite its watch

i know a number of people are here to

oppose congestion pricing i want to urge

them including representative gotheimer

to seriously consider the benefits of

reduced traffic for drivers

reduced traffic

would decrease the amount of time you

spend in the car when you do have to

drive in and out of the city if you're a

commuter that means more time to do what

you want to do at work or at home

if you drive around to different work

sites in midtown and lower manhattan the

time saved means more jobs and more

income that would do more

that would more than offset the

additional toll the benefits for

everyone are clear and i

i fully support it thank you

===

hello can you guys see

hi

thank you for hosting this meeting and

allowing the public to provide comments

i encourage the mta and all other

institutional stakeholders across this

tri-state metropolitan region including

the port authority of new york and new

jersey to collaborate in decision making

for all not just their artificially

siloed constituencies i oppose

congestion pricing as a proposal as a

proposal and ultimately adopted by the

new york legislature ever since i was a

resident in brooklyn with an assemblyman

carroll's district unfortunately the new

york legislature decided a new fee a

euphemism for tax without determining

how to spend it

was the best idea to serve the public

what kind of governance style is it to

levy attacks without direction on how to

implement the tax no ladies and

gentlemen this isn't a banana republic

it's new york state where accountability

your government is limited at best or

non-existent at worst

proponents of congestion taxes have now

had two years to build their case for

congestion pricing the tax has to be

levied by law now we are condescended to

that is for our own good because of all

the evaluation undertaken

it is interesting that the city and

state of new york claim to care about

these issues but only see additional

taxes as a means of achieving their

aspirations something they have been

unwilling or incapable of managing for

the better part of forever

legislators and bureaucrats have chosen

to ignore effective means of reducing

congestion without extracting funds from

users it goes without saying the mta

could spend less spend its current

budget more efficiently and use other

means of congestion reduction like

using existing

tolling

infrastructure and implementing two-way

tolling on existing infrastructure

expanding traffic calming measures and

road diets and road pedestrianizing

as to promoting equity well i'm almost

done but the people that are going to

benefit the most from congestion pricing

are the wealthy manhattan residents like

the prior speaker who will be able to

extract more benefits from the city at

the cost of poor people and working

class who have to commute by car

thank you

===

hello can you hear me

yes we can

good morning thank you for the board for

organizing these public hearings my name

is corey hanigan i'm a new jersey native

and i'm also a city and regional

planning master's student at rutgers in

new brunswick and i'm consulting for the

njdot within the vortex transportation

center i'd like to voice my enthusiastic

support for this proposal the recent

storms and flooding show that we can no

longer ignore the devastating effects of

climate change

things will only get worse until we take

decarbonization seriously and that means

making tough choices like switching from

cars to more space efficient and

environmentally sustainable modes like

trains and buses

you know many people drive because

transit's unreliable and i understand

that but it's impossible to improve bus

service when the roads are filled to the

brim with personal cars and ride share

we cannot continue to assume driving as

a default people make choices on how to

get around based on the infrastructure

available to them

and changing the balance of incentives

could encourage many more people to

consider alternative modes alternative

times or even work remotely

private vehicles account for less than a

quarter of the total bridge crossings

into manhattan every day but they

consume the vast majority of street

space and transportation funding both in

new jersey and in new york they are also

responsible for the overwhelming

majority of transportation related

deaths and they are major sources of

local air pollutants like ground level

ozone and fine particulate matter which

are responsible for 95 of all air

pollution related deaths these

pollutants impact lung and brain

function on the day of exposure and

developmentally so that includes

everyone working in manhattan that drove

in surrounded by gas-powered cars but it

also includes a large and growing number

of new jerseyans in new jersey city and

in newark and other cities sliced

through by our highway network you know

the census showed a growth of 80 000

people in jersey city in newark alone

and these are new families that have

children that breathe the exhaustive

cars every day we drive past workers who

drive into manhattan earn significantly

more than those who take the train

especially those they drive past they're

also more likely to be white and poor

residents are less likely on a car and

overwhelming the people who live near

highways are low income and people of

color this has been implemented in

singapore amsterdam

it's a benefit for everyone i urge you

to consider the benefits of cleaner air

for all of us thank you

===
good morning my name is lauren paterno

i'm speaking on behalf of aaa clubs of

new jersey which serves approximately 2

million members across the state of new

jersey

first we are grateful to the mta for

providing hearings across the regions

which will be impacted by the central

business district holding program this

is certainly a step in the right

direction to ensure the public has an

opportunity to be heard

the mta currently charges different

rates to drivers based on whether their

ezpass was issued by a new york customer

service center or some other agency the

out of state ez pass rate is more than

50 percent higher than the new york e-z

pass rate in our opinion this practice

is unfair and takes advantage of an

unsuspecting interstate drivers for

example driving one way on the henry

hudson bridge costs 7.50 for an out of

state easy pass user 4.50 more than the

new york easy pass user pays this

disparity is far higher than most other

agencies we believe the mta should not

charge differential rates to easy pest

users in the central business tolling

program

additionally in the interest of fairness

and to eliminate the practice dubbed as

bridge and tunnel shopping

any program implemented should equalize

tolls for all entrants to the pricing

zone and drivers coming into the zone

via the george washington bridge should

not be subject to a double toll lastly

we respectfully request an exemption for

service vehicles emergency vehicles tow

trucks and light duty service vehicles

all provide essential safety functions

in new york city in fact in london all

vehicles classified as recovery vehicles

are eligible for 100 discount because

those vehicles facilitate flow of

traffic by aiding and removing disabled

vehicles new york city should follow the

london model for all service and

recovery vehicles we thank you for the

opportunity to testify today

===
good morning uh can you hear me we can

okay thank you very much uh my name is

dianna feinberg i'm a professional

planner in new jersey

engaged for many years in development

and transportation issues in the north

jersey area i'm also speaking as a

member of the meadowlands chamber and

the fair congestion pricing alliance

i have to say i've been dismayed so far

by the lack of engagement with new

jersey during the formulation of the

congestion pricing program framework new

york new jersey and connecticut are all

part of a connected regional economy

linked by our transportation systems

the labor force and many economic ties

new jersey is also new york's largest

commuter shed

and growing commuter shed the same

people the city wants to lure back to

revive its office economy

not to mention supporting its cultural

institutions and retail businesses

however unlike the metro north and lirr

regions

new jersey has no seat on the

transportation mobility review board

which will shape the program neither

will new jersey under the current plan

receive any revenue from congestion

pricing this ignores the role that new

jersey and specifically new jersey

transit play in the regional economy and

specifically the new york city economy

so what i would like to to

ask is that new jersey be assigned beat

on the trmb pmrb

and be a full partner in evaluating and

structuring the program

in addition the environmental assessment

should address the full range of

potential social economic and

infrastructure impacts on new jersey i

understand the focus on the cbd but

there are also impacts to be examined on

this side of the river including impacts

on transit and traffic circulation and

congestion

and where the burden of tolls will fall

on new jersey's population

thank you

===

hello

yes hi

hi good morning i am jana ternitz i'm

the deputy director of the tri-state

transportation campaign we appreciate

the opportunity to provide public

comment today in support of congestion

pricing tri-state is a 501c3 nonprofit

advocacy organization dedicated to

mobility accessibility equity equity and

livability in new jersey new york and

connecticut long championed by

environmental justice and transportation

advocates new york city's congestion

pricing plan is an example of a targeted

approach to reducing traffic congestion

enhancing the availability and

reliability of public transportation

improving local air quality congestion

pricing revenue will be used to

accomplish the goals of providing

modernized subway signals making the

system almost fully accessible improving

bus service and bringing metro north

trains to penn station in fact new

jersey transit commuters many of whom

transfer to mta buses and subways upon

reaching the cbd will also reap huge

benefits in the improvements funded

through congestion pricing in a recent

analysis tri-state found that the impact

on new jersey drivers is minimal as a

nominal amount of new jersey residents

actually drive into the cbd for work in

all legislative districts surveyed only

single-digit percentages of residents

work in the cbd and commute by private

vehicle across all districts an average

of 1.6 of workers will be subject to the

congestion charge public transit is the

primary mode of choice of the majority

of manhattan cbd workers in every

district that was analyzed on average

77.5 percent of manhattan cbd workers

who use public transportation to dvd

from new jersey the majority of

districts public transportation

commuters have a lower median income

than commuters who drive into

manhattan's cbd given the effect of

covet on work and commuting patterns and

more people are working from home unless

the impact on driving commuters from new

jersey is lower than the census data in

our analysis shows tri-state has been

fighting for congestion pricing for well

over a decade and now is finally within

reach we cannot afford to delay any

longer thank you

===

yes hi

hi

uh good morning my name is zoe baldwin

and i'm the new jersey director for the

regional plan association a nearly 100

year old civic organization working

toward better mobility economic

opportunity and a more resilient

metropolitan region

for decades we've strongly supported

congestion pricing because we see it as

a centerpiece of a set of policies that

will lead to a greener more equitable

region however many in new jersey have

expressed valid concerns about how this

will impact drivers and communities on

this side of the hudson as a lifelong

new jersey resident i fully understand

those concerns and appear today to

reiterate the congestion pricing

benefits new jerseyans a great deal

while new jersey drivers have always

paid tolls to cross the hudson river

many from new york and connecticut have

avoided this by crossing a free city

owned crossings such as the brooklyn

bridge but with toll credits in place at

all three new jersey crossings this new

policy would level that playing field

four out of five new jersey commuters

already use transit to cross the hudson

river and congestion pricing will reduce

the traffic for that small percentage

that do need to drive into the central

business district our estimates show

that this program will decrease traffic

by about 15 percent during traffic busy

periods which is good for our commutes

our commerce and our air quality

additionally congestion pricing will

improve the city's public transportation

system which is used by a vast majority

of new jersey commuters once they cross

the river further facilitating a smooth

ride to work in 2019 rpa produced a

report that laid out recommendations for

implementation and is available on our

website at rpa.org

two of the key recommendations focused

on the need for mta to provide toll

credits to drivers at the three hudson

river crossings and to vary that fee by

the level of congestion at different

times of the day these recommendations

will eliminate unwanted traffic shifts

caused by drivers shopping for cheapest

holes and will incentivize off-peak

travel further reducing congestion

across the region

mta should incorporate these

recommendations and also analyze

localized traffic impacts in new jersey

neighborhoods the bottom line is that

congestion pricing is a big win for the

entire region and we strongly urge the

mta to consider the impacts it will have

on both sides of the hudson river and

implement it fairly and equitably thank

you

thank you

===

hello can you hear me

yes we can

okay

this is raymond nguyen

i'm a new jersey resident

uh currently residing in newark and a

student

of the new jersey institute of

technology

majoring in industrial engineering um

with also

private interests in

urban planning and

transit related issues

having come into the city many times

by both uh

car and by transit

and having studied the matter

i would like to express my support

for the proposal and i would consider

that as

a long time in coming

the

extra the externalities which are

imposed by

the

by motor vehicles

are generally not captured and are

increasingly

not captured as

inflation has cut away at the gas tax

and vehicles have become more fuel

efficient

while new york city of course does not

dictate national policy it can at least

relieve itself from some of the

externalities that have been imposed in

its own area

including imposing long commutes on

those who actually do need private

vehicles

um

as well as potentially shaping longer

track patterns

therefore i would like to say that i

that i am supportive of the measure to

introduce congestion pricing into

uh the central business district

that is all thank you very much

===
i'm here

hi we can hear you

there we go this is what the screen

presents to you

um

there you go i'm steve corrales the

director of government and public

affairs for the new jersey chapter of

the national motors association a

motorist advocate advocacy organization

i've led the state chapter for close to

35 years and during that time have

commented on just about all toll matters

impacting new jersey motorists

on that note the nma joins with new

jersey federal state and local officials

to ensure that this tolling program

credits tolls paid on all bridges and

tunnels from new jersey that provide

access to the central business district

that includes the george washington

bridge

on a broader note this congestion

pricing tolling program also known as a

legalized money grab from motorists to

note the following four things

first don't convince yourself that

congestion pricing implementations in

other countries will translate well to a

program in the u.s even in new york city

you should be more realistic about the

problems that were experienced elsewhere

second the calculated costs of time and

money of congestion to businesses

commuters and residents are some of the

supposed justifications for the program

however those costs fail to take into

account that they are preferred by

motorists for the broader benefits that

driving or sharing a vehicle provides

over public transit

that has its own

problems and contributions to lost time

and

question money if congestion doesn't

improve will

uh tolls be raised further until it does

and since motorists are paying a new

cost for supposed better service what

are you going to do in conjunction with

new york city d.o.t to improve

congestion beyond anticipated price

gouging

fourth how are you going to handle toll

collection problems that aren't the

fault of motorists the state of new york

has a poor track record in that regard

in closing be very careful motorists

won't tolerate being a cash cow

if they don't see value in fairness

please conclude your remarks

thank you

===

thank you for your time today i just got

a uh heard that somebody from rpa

said that

people in new jersey were diverting to

the brooklyn uh bridge for their commute

and that's all you need to know about

the credibility of rpa that's absolutely

ridiculous

what's really happening here is that new

york wants to preserve a six dollar

community for residents of new york city

on their subways and buses

and they expect new jerseyans to pay 45

a day to commute

so you talked about environmental

justice but what about the economic

justice what about the social justice of

the situation where a sitting duck in

new jersey is supposed to say i'm not

going to change my computation pattern

i'll pay 40 a day to commute or

i'll go on already full and at maximum

capacity buses uh and trains from new

jersey that's just not going to happen

that way

and you guys know it's not going to

happen that way so this whole process is

dishonest

the fact of the matter is you need 15

billion dollars to fix your stuff

because you haven't maintained it and

now you want new jerseyans to pay it in

the cost of their commute but you know

what we're going to do instead

we're going to do what we've been doing

during the pandemic we're going to stay

in new jersey

so in order for new york to have a

recovery

that's broad that's inclusive you can't

have congestion pricing because you're

going to discourage people from coming

in and doing the things that new york

needs which is bringing economic

activity back to the city

so we need to look no further than the

fact that the agency determining the

tolls is

a

bridge and tunnel

you don't have a seat at the table for

nj transit you don't have a seat at the

table for port authority of new york and

new jersey and the

incredible moment is it's port

authorities bridges and tunnels they're

bringing these riders in and you don't

have them on your on your board

this whole thing's ridiculous

everybody's been saying i appreciate the

opportunity to talk i'll give one more

take on that i don't appreciate the

opportunity to talk i resent the fact

that we're having to spend resources to

contest this ridiculous program

thank you

===
hi good morning can you hear me

we can

i'm not sure why the camera's not coming

on i apologize for that

um

oh here i am sorry

okay here i am sorry

okay um

so i'm actually a member of the two of

the demographics impacted i am a

resident of um southern

manhattan south of 60th i'm more precise

of southern battery park city i also

work in morristown new jersey so

i'm i would like to address many aspects

but i'm going to focus on the impact of

my neighborhood i haven't have all the

i've come to many of these meetings and

i've heard

hardly anyone address this

that southern battery park city is a

unique neighborhood we are roughly one

half mile long

and two blocks wide we are cut off from

the rest of manhattan by west side

highway

so i understand westside highway is not

going to have a pole so does that mean

we can go on west side highway enjoy a

ride around the perimeter of manhattan

but we cannot enter the rest of

manhattan so a resident in

baidai which is two blocks from me can

drive all the way to 59th and back no

penalty because it's our understanding

that if you stay within the grid you're

not penalized but those in battery park

city cannot access the rest of manhattan

you may say well why do we need to we

can take subway the closest subway here

is a half a mile and that's just a

couple lines the other ones are further

so

if you're elderly unfortunately you know

i'm mobile but a lot of elderly

residents cannot they have to take cabs

or drive themselves cabs are already

having the uh congested pricing

in their in their uh tolls so

we need more information about how this

is going to impact you know you're

talking about like this whole thing in

manhattan as if it's unified it's

our little area is unique and we need

more information the lack of

transparency is really troubling thanks

thank you

===
good morning i'm cara girl research and

communications associate at the

permanent citizens advisory committee to

the mta pcac

i'm also speaking as someone who can't

drive but as friends and family in new

jersey i frequently take the path in new

jersey transit to get there from

brooklyn and while neither option is

perfect public transit gets me where i

need to go i know that congestion

pricing will only speed up maya and so

many other ships to jersey by reducing

traffic and funding critical transit

improvements to get us to and from the

past and njt the argument that transit

doesn't get you anywhere in and out of

or to new jersey doesn't ring true

instead of trying to stop congestion

pricing from happening elected officials

west of the hudson might consider

investing that same energy and improving

their own transit systems transit riders

need congestion pricing now more than

ever it's the only feasible way to

substantially raise funding for the mta

without raising ferris it'll bring in a

steady stream of money for key

improvements to the region's transit and

commuter rail far beyond the five

boroughs

facing coveted and worse than climate

change the additional billions of

dollars from congestion pricing could

not be more important for rise for

riders coming from jersey and beyond and

for those who still choose to drive

it'll help speed up the trip

particularly relevant this climate week

the environmental benefits of congestion

pricing cannot be understated as we

learn from historic storms and flooding

this summer the mta needs significant

funding to build a more resilient

regional transit system that can

withstand the forces of extreme weather

congestion pricing will bring the

billions of dollars we need to repair

our transit while also improving air

quality decreasing traffic around the

metropolitan area and making the region

less car dependent

constant bumper to bumper traffic can be

a thing of the past improving quality of

life and commutes all over the region we

deserve reliable and frequent service

across our subways buses and commuter

rail and finally thanks to congestion

pricing the 21st century transit system

our 21st century region desperately

needs is insight thank you

===
let me know

yes we can hear you great okay my name

is rafael wakefield i live in jersey

city

thank you for giving me another chance

to get connected my message to the

federal highway administration is that

this outreach is a waste of time and far

too extensive stop wasting time and

money soliciting complaints from cranks

all the way to pennsylvania the dually

elected new york state legislature has

passed this legislation and should be

locked enacted without delay there

should be no exemptions for anyone

beyond what is mandated by federal law

except for taxis working in new york

city today the excessive traffic backs

up through the holland tunnel and into

jersey city the walking riding and

biking public has taken enough abuse as

far as the objections raised regarding

new jersey specifically these never get

around to blaming the actual villain

which is the unaccountable undemocratic

port authority that prioritizes cars

even as a buses language in the george w

george washington bridge and the lincoln

tunnel the state of affairs is

ridiculous it's unacceptable no other

major city in the world the developing

world developed world anyway works this

way for good reason it's it's moronic we

deserve to have a life without constant

honking and constant car congestion and

not cater to the tiny minority of people

driving into and out of manhattan thank

you

===

so can you hear me

yes we can hear you please speak up

yes my name is michael golds i'm a

supporter of the fair congestion pricing

alliance here in new jersey and one of

my main concerns is that you cite on

your website the mta

and we do support congestion pressures

because we we need

cleaner streets we need cleaner air and

all that stuff but

what you do say on your website you cite

london you cite singapore and you cite

all the other cities that have

successfully uh instituted congestion

pricing yet those cities had already

improved their public transit before

instituting congestion pricing so as i

am a commuter and i do commute

frequently in and out of the city i know

that there are

major major major problems with

infrastructure not only with new jersey

transit but with the mta with the buses

and with the subways and everything else

so until there's major major upgrades to

the system i don't see how

any congestion pricing fee tax scheme

whatever you want to call it is going to

help improve a system that's already

failing on its own you you need to

improve the system first to then shift

the transit the of the community people

to public transit in order to free up

the roads and until you do that i fear

that this is a disaster waiting to

happen you're just going to clog up the

roads even more

and new jersey transit does not have the

capacity so therefore

these tolls if suggested should also be

shared with new jersey so new jersey

improve their public transit and we can

get congestion prices to the goal that

is what it's supposed to do right now as

it stands new jersey needs a seat at the

table the federal government needs to

step in and oversee the process so every

party involved is treated equitably

thank you

thank you

===

i'm here

my name is congressman bill pascarelle i

represent the ninth district of north

jersey

i'm here because once again new jersey

and new jersey folks

are getting stuck with the short end of

the state we in new jersey are quite

used to paying our fair share

but this proposed pricing scheme

is a bridge too far

and new jersey has barely had a say in

the matter despite efforts to coordinate

new yorkers marching forward all alone

they're trying to jam a tax hike onto

the backs of new jersey commuters it is

wrong

it's unacceptable and it cannot stand

many don't realize that manhattan's

roads are federally aid roadways

in the zone there are 443 lane miles of

federal-aid roadways

that have been renovated

and upgraded thanks to countless federal

investments funded by the american

driver

223

of those lane miles are part of the

national highway system

it is unfair for new york to limit

access to roads

that we all paid for without consulting

its neighbors and then charge an extra

fee on top this is an extra tax on new

jersey drivers

i call it hutzpah

i fear the so-called environmental

assessment

is a rushed rubber stamp we need a

full-blown environmental impact

statement

we sent a letter to secretary

butterswegg

uh back in april we outlined our many

concerns of demand and only fairness we

have still not heard any reply that is

an outrage

president biden promised not to raise

taxes on middle-class families i hope

federal officials remember the

commitment as they review the scheme we

need a real environmental review on the

impact of all

stakeholders uh will are already

overburdened mass transit is to be able

to handle us

and so uh you've got the pitch

that i'm presenting today

and i'm just wondering won't

the volume increase when folks in the in

the zone and this is not just

not necessarily cbd

see that there's less traffic and then

they'll join the traffic which they

never wanted to get into in the first

place

thank you very much for listening and

much more to say but there will be

plenty of time

thank you

===

hello thank you very much

my name is jonathan schwedel i'm a

resident of jersey city and i support

congestion pricing

there was a study actually released

today which said that less than two

percent of new jersey commuters in the

manhattan central business district

commute by far as opposed to other modes

like mass transportation

as a jersey city resident

i live near 78

and one thing about living near there is

there's a lot of traffic as well as a

lot of environmental pollution

and the benefits from congestion pricing

won't just go to new york city residents

as a jersey jersey city resident having

congestion pricing will make my life

much better for those reasons thank you

very much

===

uh can you hear me

yes we can hear you all right there you

go um thank you um uh and you can see me

okay um i just want to present my name

is miguel ramirez i'm a permanent

resident of pacific new jersey and i

just want to say the central business

district trolling program as presented

is not a good idea and for various

reasons should be cancelled or at least

modified seriously

if the concern is true it's truly

traffic volume and pollution

instead of instituting a massive

electronic system that cost hundreds of

millions of dollars to install i would

imagine and creating another

bureaucratic tooling system in the

nation's already highest and most told

area

and across the board ban on auto traffic

during the proposed hours is a much

better way to go

first it truly cuts down on traffic and

pollution

makes for a completely equitable system

where no one pays for permission to

pollute the air

and it's just to all motorists

regardless of one's income level

charging drivers to drive in a regulated

area sounds like a hypocritical system

when those who pay a fee or toll have

rain and freedom then

not offered to others who may not have

the means to pay yet another toll or fee

in the greater new york area

it strikes up another way to raise

revenue instead of true concern for

creation and the stewardship of the

environment

finally a complete ban on auto traffic

with exceptions of course for mobile

transportation would be much better

simpler to implement and send a message

that the city is truly concerned about

pollution and traffic and not digging

for more cash from an overly burden

public with unreasonable and

ever-present tolls finally thank you for

allowing for public discourse and i

sincerely hope that the concept be

revisited and adapted to better serve

its intention and the people of the new

york metropolitan area thank you

===

hello my name is isaac alvarez

i i prefer not to use my video

um

anyway uh yeah so

this is not a terrible idea to have

congestion pricing i i live in south

jersey um so it's you know it's not like

i commute to new york on the regular but

i do have family in new york and

go there every now and then

and

but but i still feel for people in north

jersey

and i think the real elephant in the

room is that there is inadequate uh

transportation

mass transit across the river it is

absolutely unacceptable that there are

only two tracks in north river tunnel we

need a far greater regional connectivity

like they have in europe

um also the path train needs to be

better especially on weekends i'm not

sure if this

congestion pricing is going to be done

on weekends i think it's better

not to do it on weekends uh especially

also you know the subway there are the

geos

and the commuter rail with metro north

and now irr it's those don't run as much

on weekends

but other than that i will say that

there's there needs to be credit for

people who already use the toll bridges

and tunnels so they're not double

charged

and

just because it'll reduce congestion

doesn't always mean

everything you know like these car free

streets and you know removing parking

space are always a good thing

um because they do inconvenience people

and yes i realize there are issues but

you know

you you want to be careful if you're

going to afford people to change their

lifestyles and lastly i'll say two

things first there needs to be

transparency about the benefits the

specific

improvements to mass transit that

congestion pricing will allow for

and

i'll only end off on this

this cannot be a substitute for taxing

millionaires and billionaires

who are responsible for most of

pollution in the first place and much

more to give

thank you

our next feature will be deirdre huntley

smith followed by claude cornetti

thank you i hope everyone can hear me my

name is deidra huntley smith and i am a

resident of rahway new jersey

i am also a motorcyclist belonging to

the sirens women's motorcycle club of

new york city and also the moving

violations of boston

um and

i'd like to talk about the central

business district towing program with

respect to how the toll is going to be

applied to all vehicles there is

currently

no

discussion about an exemption for

motorcycles

motorcycles and scooters are two-wheel

vehicles

that can

help to

to prevent some of the congestion

and and some of the environmental impact

that we currently experience

on our our streets

um

it is there are studies that have been

shown that the

if more cars are taken off the street

and more people were riding motorcycles

and scooters

we would see a a significant

decrease in congestion

and also

a significant decrease in

our uh

our footprint on this earth

i'm also concerned

uh for the people who

live

north of the 60th street

[Music]

because they are going to bear

the

increased traffic potentially

from people who are trying to find ways

around um the central business district

towing area

and i would suggest that we need to look

at some other alternatives to how this

be done seems a bit rushed to me

and i don't believe it's well thought

out and that it's not really going to

benefit

minority areas

as well as

the federal studies

suggest that we should thank you

===

hello can you guys hear me

yes

okay great uh this is claude i'm a

resident of bergen county um and with

respect to the central business district

tolling program i do have

um you know three comments to make

so the first one is we definitely need

to improve mass transit options

coming you know i guess from new jersey

into manhattan

i do believe that new jersey transit is

at a breaking point with respect to

its infrastructure and i do think that

given that the mta is just an equal

partner as far as public transit agency

uh to the extent that you know the

revenue comes in from this tolling

program that should be shared with the

regional transit agencies uh

particularly because new jersey folks

coming into manhattan do contribute to

the economic

uh

welfare of new york city

additionally

i believe that the tolling program

should not be put into place

until the gateway

tunneling project will actually

be completed i know that that is a

pretty extensive project it was

unfortunately

you know killed off by the previous

administration but i do think that that

is important in order to allow um you

know higher uh train capacity going

through the hudson tunnels uh from new

jersey to new york

and uh the last point i have to make is

with respect to commercial transit

into the

uh cbd area i do believe that those

deliveries should be scheduled uh in the

night hours so that you know if

deliveries do happen during the day that

i believe those companies doing the

deliveries should bear a heavier uh

brunt of

of the impact of you know um

environmental issues pollution i i do

believe that there's a lot of trucks a

lot of times when i go on my commute to

manhattan that basically do uh come into

the the city these conclude their

remarks in the morning hours so i do

believe

uh that you know commercial transit

should be uh making those deliveries

during the night hours and with that i

thank you for your time thank you

===

sorry had a little uh

a little trouble connecting here

i apologize thank you a few glitches uh

my name's diana feinberg thank you for

the time this evening i am a resident of

bergen county new jersey and a

professional planner and also speak as a

board member of the meadowlands chamber

and fair congestion pricing alliance

like to share a few thoughts

a while it may be appealing to look to

outsiders as a source of funds in the

long run it would be more equitable and

effective

to engage all the region's partners

including new jersey in solutions to

transportation issues including transit

investment particularly when the whole

tri-state area is still struggling to

rebound from the pandemic

one of the legacies of that pandemic is

of course the continuation of work from

home hybrid work arrangements and a

resulting flattening an extension of

peak hour travel

which prompts many questions one how

will this trend factor into calculating

the toll prices will the traffic impact

studies accurately measure these trends

for new jersey

we've read that only a fraction of new

jersey commuters drive but that's based

on pre-pandemic statistics which

can't be relied on now to accurately

assess the impact on peak hour or

off-peak the late-shift workers it also

raises the question if such a small

number of drivers will be affected how

will the mta re achieve its funding goal

particularly when revenue will be met of

the system's operating costs which have

not been identified to date

is there any congestion price point i

wonder that will be off limits although

necessary to meet the statutory target

these many questions so the complexity

of congestion pricing and reinforce the

importance of including new jersey as a

full partner in the process i would also

point out in relation to alternatives in

the assessment that the 2018 fixed new

york study did identify other members

other measures for reducing congestion

and raising revenue

such as studying and assessing bus

congestion thank you very much

===

hi folks i'm ron simoncini from the fair

congestion pricing alliance

i wanted to echo

ms feinberg's comments which i think are

probably the most thoughtful

and informed that we've heard on any of

these hearings and certainly

more revealing than what we've seen in

in the outlines for the study itself

which largely relies on uh

environmental justice uh to make its

case

and it might ring true if the fact was

that you could transfer any of these

drivers into public transportation from

new jersey which you can't because we

don't have the capacity i think if you

look at the

various programs that are happening

right now in the transportation area in

the meat in the region

this certainly is something that needs

to be looked at but it's not the

priority the priority for all of us is

getting gateway done the priority is the

port authority bus terminal the priority

is using cares act money efficiently so

that it through the region

eases transportation woes for drivers

who encounter bad roadways and difficult

logistics

so that's where our priority and our

thoughts should be i think if you're

looking for a signal as to how poorly

thought out this plan was though

you have to look no further than the

recent coverage of it you have to look

no further than the fact that our

governor who's one of the most sedate

people on the planet

is

saying that he might reject and and uh

veto the port authorities minutes to

stop this

our congressmen both

relatively progressive congressman uh

bill pascrell and and josh gottheim are

a more moderate person both of them have

their own reasons for rejecting this and

i think when you look at all that and

you sum it all up together you guys are

in a beauty contest that you're running

as judge and you're a contestant and i

think you're gonna win that beauty

contest like anybody would win a beauty

contest where they're the sole judge

somebody needs to come in and referee

this thing as an independent third party

who doesn't have a dog in the fight and

if you were honorable you'd invite that

person in now and end this charade

please conclude your remarks

===

hello

we can hear you okay uh there's been a

lot of good comments so far and to add

mine is that

i think we can all uh agree that there

is a congestion problem

uh it stands to reason that a lot of

people living in manhattan are in favor

of this uh this tax

uh which is in addition to a toll which

is also a tax my complaint is that over

the years the city

was asking for this has caused most of

the congestion

um

they uh and they and they want the

people to pay for it the city has

sanctioned dozens of high-rise

residential buildings

uh over a hundred thousand units over

the last few years

uh they created uh sitting areas that

took away from streets

uh crosstown streets

took away a lane for buses only which i

can understand is justifiable

uh more recently lanes have been lost to

bicycles

both for

riding

and storage

lanes have also been used for outdoor

dining now

finally after years of encouraging and

promoting mass transit

the city has scared people away with the

covet

19 fear

and people are hesitant to uh go back to

public transportation

um

and now basically what this ends up to

be is a penalty

on people that are trying to earn a

living

you know this tax is also going to

subsidize mta which i understand they

needed but the mta

is also being subsidized

by other you know both federally and the

bridges and how much more

um you know can the people

people pay

that's all i have

===

good evening my name is thane ren and

i'm a resident of hoboken

and i'm here to speak up in favor of

this proposal

it's already been noted that uh more

commun more new jersey commuters into

manhattan take public transit than drive

it's also the case that substantially

more new jersey commuters enter the

central business district in manhattan

take public transit than drive

and also as i think we're all aware

on average driving commuters have higher

income than public transit commuters so

these relatively affluent drivers

even though they have relatively small

numbers they impose a cost on everyone

else that is far higher than their small

numbers and that cost includes

the cost of noise of air pollution and

just this space they take up on the

roads bridges and tunnels that takes

away space from public transit commuters

who are much more efficient at getting

into the city

and it's been mentioned that there's

concerns about the capacity

well the goal i think of this um

uh

business district tolling program would

be to shift some of those drivers onto

transit even a small number shifting

onto transit would greatly ease the

congestion and allow more people

to use those access points into the city

it's also important and a point that i

don't think has been made enough yet

this this evening that we speak up for

the substantial environmental benefits

that new jerseyans would reap from this

proposal

especially for residents of cities along

the major traffic corridors

who currently suffer adverse effects

from traffic congestion into new york

including noise and air pollution

and of course the common experience of

having traffic back up onto our city

streets

when there's too much too many cars

trying to get into the tunnels or onto

the bridges

so easing some of that congestion

through this business or

tolling program

would significantly improve the

environmental quality of life for the

large number of new jersey residents who

live along those traffic corridors so

it's a great proposal and i hope it goes

forward thank you

===

yes can you hear me

yes

okay my name is ralph gatterman i'm a

resident of bergen county

and today i would like to express my

opposition to any form of congestion

pricing in the central business district

of manhattan

clearly a congestion pricing plan is

discriminatory discriminatory for that

portion of the traveling public that

requires access to

or through that portion of new york city

even if only for minimal occupancy for

travel elsewhere within new york city

for example it's unclear if the proposed

pricing details uh thus far revealed

defined entry into the central business

district to exclude exiting the fdr

drive at 71st street 61st creed 53rd

street for the purpose of transitioning

to the 59th street bridge over the east

river likewise

charges for exiting the fdr to local

streets to access the other east river

bridges in areas below 60th street are

unclear

what is clear is that such vehicles are

not the core of congestion to the

central business district origin

destinations are common to new jersey

residents from

any of the new jersey counties to the

other boroughs of new york city and the

congesting pricing initiative will have

significant negative financial and

discriminatory discriminatory effects on

new jersey residents moreover access

into the central business district by

new jersey residents denies new jersey

residents access to significant work

medical entertainment and social

opportunities simply because other forms

of reliable cost effective and

convenient mass and private

transportation options are not available

or are clearly impractical

it is is it

for medical

patients to that desire new york city's

major hospitals in the central business

district to pay a toll to avail

themselves with such services i think

not

um it should be clear that while mass

transit may serve a significant uh

number of new jersey residents it does

not serve all for regular commuters it

should be obvious that that portion of

jersey residents entering the central

business district by car

simply do not have other practical

economic efficient or convenient

transportation options available

no amount of mta funding will ever

satisfy their specific please conclude

your remarks

that concludes my remarks for tonight

thank you very much

===
okay

can you hear me

yes we can

okay great

um hi i'm leslie stevens i live in

somerset county about an hour and a half

from penn station via new jersey transit

i represent the non-profit 350 nyc

where our large team of activists

support congestion pricing

the overarching goals of congestion

pricing are three

as we see it

one to reduce the traffic congestion

that has come accelerating back already

90 percent of pre-pandemic levels and

this is with many people still working

remotely

to

ensure the viability of public transit

in new york city especially the sub is

in buses

and the connecting transit to places

like new jersey

three

reduce emissions both greenhouse gases

and polluting toxins like nitrogen oxide

and small particulate matter that are

known health hazards

new york should have the world's best

and greenest urban public transportation

including new jersey transit and path

right now we eat a regional connectivity

and fund sharing new jersey transit is

in dire need of upgrades to encourage

people to return to transit

i also want to just comment that new

york city contributes about 30 percent

of greenhouse gas emissions mainly from

cars and tracks new jersey is 40

and with worsening congestion traffic is

driving up greenhouse gases we have less

than 10 years to stop this from a

climate crisis

we must implement congestion price

pricing quickly learning from the best

of other cities and include major

disincentives to cast diesel vehicles

and

and to incentivize public transit and

shared modes of transportation thank you

for my confidence

===

good evening my name is doug o'malley i

serve as the director of environment new

jersey which represents more than twenty

thousand uh citizen members and sixty

thousand activists across the garden

state uh we are still reeling from the

impacts of hurricane ida which clearly

showed the impacts of extreme weather

across the metropolitan area as well as

wreaking havoc on roads and transit

we also need to remember the largest

source of air pollution in the

metropolitan region comes from our cars

and trucks we drive 75 percent in new

jersey 66

across all of new york those numbers

skyrocket for lower manhattan

and while we're still dealing with the

impacts of the pandemic we've seen a

near total rebound of car and truck

traffic in new york we have not seen

that same rebound for new jersey transit

or for strap hangers as a whole we are

at a critical moment of time that we

need to provide dedicated funding for

transit for both mta and new jersey

transit and we need to do everything we

can to

ensure that we're providing a congestion

pricing plan this project isn't perfect

it should be strengthened to include

more funding for projects that benefit

new jersey strap hangers and give new

jersey more of a say and the reason is

very simple eighty percent of new jersey

commuters into new york are strap

hangers but obviously folks traveling in

the cbd are also coming from new jersey

and so we know that new jersey transit

strap hangers are paying twice our

drivers should should pay as well to

ensure that we are improving mass

transit options

specifically that means that we

should have new jersey transit have a

seat on the mta congestion pricing board

we should ensure that revenue should be

shared with njt and path and have a

focus on projects to help all of us like

the gateway project like the gw bridge

and having a dedicated bus lane there

and making sure

that we're doing more to analyze the

traffic across the bridge in jersey city

hoboken fort lee

let me just conclude by saying that this

is an idea whose time has come the

debate has happened for years and we

need to do everything we can to reduce

air pollution and increase funding for

mass transit thank you

===

uh hi

um

i'd like to start off by saying thank

you for giving me the time to speak

my name is chris pryor i live in newark

new jersey

and i'd like to register my enthusiastic

support for congestion pricing

congestion pricing is such an exciting

first step in the direction of more

livable healthier communities in north

jersey

right now excessive driving is doing so

much harm and doing so much to pollute

our communities

both in new york and in new jersey

and in new jersey we have we have

drivers clogging our roads as they head

into those tunnels into manhattan

um congestion congestion in our area is

an emergency we have more congestion

than ever there's been an increase in

car accidents and pedestrian deaths

and you know let's not forget in newark

that one in every four kids has asthma

we are

literally gassing ourselves

um

reducing congestion has so many benefits

um you know several of the speakers have

outlined those better than i can

it makes our cities better places to

live reduces noise helps the buses go

faster improves our transit

it's going to make not only new york but

also all the cities in the new york area

better places to live

so i enthusiastically support the mta in

implementing congestion pricing i urge

them to get it done as soon as possible

um

you know as has been said

we've been talking about congestion

pricing since 2007. now is the time to

get it done

===

hello can everybody hear me

yes

yes hello my name is michael golds i'm

with the fair congestion pricing

alliance a lot of has been said very

very

educated throughout the presentation

this morning especially through diana

feinberg a very very educated uh

city planner and and

uh a lot of what people are saying today

is very very valid we need to

cut congestion we need to clean the air

but the only way we can do that is by

increasing public transit and by

inclusion public transit only on the new

york side it's not going to have a true

value unless you increase

the efficiency of new jersey transit

it's not going to happen i lived in new

york for 10 years i took subways often i

would not take the subway i would walk

30 blocks instead because the subway was

reliable guess what fares kept on going

up and

the service got worse and let's look at

this second avenue subway line

started in 1972 the first or second part

of it just got completed a few years ago

so if you think this is going to help

out increase the mta's public transit

deficit it's wrong it's not going to

happen another point is is that these

meetings

are almost a dog and pony show what

happens here is the mta is letting us

feel like we're giving our opinion but

once they close

the books closed new jersey does not

at the table and that's what we need new

jersey needs a seat at the table the

federal government needs to get involved

to make sure this process is equitable

for the entire region and not just

new york and not just the mta for

congestion pricing to work

in it's

inevitable and what it's supposed to be

is to involve everybody

thank you

===

diane sorry i was having an issue with

the unmute

apologies can you hear me

yes okay great um

so hi my name is diane martens i'm here

today to also share my enthusiastic

support for congestion pricing

although i'm a central brooklyn resident

i am a native

new jersey

resident and

i travel to hudson county almost every

weekend my typical trip consists of a

short subway connection to world trade

and then a 20-minute path ride ending

either with a two-mile walk or a bus

ride but really depends on the bus

schedule it's not very frequent um

unfortunately trains and buses are not

as ubiquitous as cars in new jersey as

they are in many new york city boroughs

and i do wholeheartedly believe that

congestion pricing in manhattan will put

more pressure on new jersey legislators

to expand more sustainable and equitable

transportation methods for new jersey

commuters

current congestion not only compromises

emergency vehicles and other critical

travel but also burdens public health

for new yorkers car pollution causes

asthma premature death and lung cancer

do we need another environmental review

to believe the science i don't

car emissions are also responsible for

accelerating extreme weather patterns

ida was a test and with dozens of

fatalities the states of new jersey and

new york failed the test

if we want a greener future with less

environmental injustices

less people driving cars i'll end with

one last point just on saturday governor

murphy tweeted climate change is real in

new jersey we're combating this threat

and protecting new jersey's future for

generations to come to my neighbors in

new jersey and governor murphy climate

change is real in new york city too and

new yorkers deserve to be able to

protect their future for generations to

come also thank you

===

oh i'm hitting on you did that go

through we can hear you there we go

okay i'm born and raised in new york and

i have a home in new jersey i'm already

paying a hefty 16 toll on the george

washington bridge with extensive backup

cause from the cross bronx that's never

been properly addressed

does new york have a congestion price a

congestion uh problem yes but the

majority of the increased congestion is

definitely the result of the changes

made in the city with the current

administration

lanes bike lanes

installed but never planned out well um

we also then have the construction

permits that are given out like free

candy taking up lanes practically every

block in the city

let's not forget the inappropriate

parking plaques that are provided by the

mayor's office to take away even more

parking then you have the filming

industry they used to give they used to

give one block for filming

now they're giving up to 10 blocks and

in most cases for two or three days of

filming there goes more parking

um they've taken away excessive metered

parking giving it for commercial parking

only

so the regular cars have absolutely no

place to go

and um the double parking has become

insane which is the biggest issue of the

problem it's one of the leading causes

um

the meter agents and i've spoken to

numerous they're told not to ticket the

double parking vehicles the double

parked vehicles they're saying that

they're told that the new york police

department's supposed to handle it you

talk to the new york police department

including internal affairs

and they say they're too busy so i hope

this is addressed one i haven't heard

anyone speak of this and um i mean

obviously it's a big issue and we

shouldn't be penalized because the city

is mismanaging

you know it's terrible

um i'm just so frustrated by this i

could hardly speak but i think you get

the gist of what i'm trying to say

thank you

===

hello

we can hear you good evening my name is

sonia schenster director of active

transportation at the tri-state

transportation campaign we appreciate

the opportunity to provide public

comment today in support of congestion

pricing as a targeted approach to reduce

traffic congestion enhance the

availability and reliability of public

transit and improve local air quality

a recent tri-state analysis made the

final following findings and

recommendations regarding this policy's

impacts on new jersey

public transit is the primary mode of

choice for the majority of new jersey's

manhattan-bound workers in every

district that was analyzed

of those commuters as many as 70 percent

transfer to

mta transit modes once they reach the

cbd

all of those commuters will directly

benefit from the upgrades to the mta

system funded partially by the tool

tolls

we recommend that in addition to

prioritizing accessibility improvements

across the systems

it should focus on major stress points

which tend to be placed with large

numbers of commuters from new jersey

this includes urgent capital

improvements needed at and around penn

station

tri-state urges a collaborative approach

in regional transit planning we urge

governor hochul the tbta mta and the

traffic mobility review board to work

with new jersey governor's office new

jersey transit port authority of new

york new jersey and both states dots to

improve mass transit options

operations and service in and out of the

cbd

this includes serious consideration of

dedicated bus lanes

working to ensure capital improvements

at penn station benefit the riders of

new jersey prioritizing new tunnels and

the gateway project

and working with the port authority to

prove not just the authority bus

terminal but actual service in and out

of the terminal as well we can't afford

to delay any longer the health of our

residents depend on it thank you

===

andrew if you and you yeah i'm here

um

i live out in

mercer county my issues with um the

congestion pricing are a number of

things people have already said so my

talking points i have to reduce them to

ones that haven't already been brought

up

um

one of the major issues is the inequity

of transit service and it's not

necessarily for new jersey but for

people in new york the transit deserts

that were studied when congestion

pricing was originally proposed back in

the bloomberg administration showed that

the people who drive most of manhattan

are those people who have the worst

transit options

my view is that we need to improve the

transit before we introduce the

congestion pricing one of the other

big impediments to transit ridership

here

is

extreme inequity in the fare structure

in europe they have integrated zone

fares it doesn't matter whether you're

on a bus or a train or the subway point

a to point b costs the same

for new jersey commuters they're already

paying a very high new jersey transit

price then they have to transfer to the

subway or the bus system and they're

paying again

same is true for long island railroad

commuters metro north commuters they

then pay again

on the mta

basically the fare structure should be

changed and transit should be improved

before congestion pricing is introduced

so that you have an equitable system for

both people using cars and transit

thank you

===

hello good evening everybody uh my name

is justin greenman and i want to thank

you for taking this opportunity to

listen to me and to allow me to speak i

come to this meeting like many of the

other uh speakers kind of wearing a

variety of hats i was born and raised in

scotch plains new jersey in union county

i'm currently though attending new york

university obviously within the central

business district zone but really my

opinions about congestion placing come

from my childhood my dad grew up in

queens out in fresh meadows and until

his parents passed away we would

frequently commute to

his parents house out in queens

and as anybody who has tried to commute

through manhattan to and out of borough

knows one of two things one is that it's

almost impossible to do it by public

transportation

it would have required at most

a train probably switching at newark

because there's no one-seat ride from

where i am

way through the city and a bus once you

get out to queens and the second thing

you'll know is that you often change

your commuting direction based on the

traffic sometimes we would go through

the lincoln tunnel onto manhattan if

that was good sometimes we would go

through the george washington bridge and

up the major deegan and out that way but

that was good every once in a while we

even did the holland tunnel and down

that way to brooklyn and that was the

way that was good

if the past year and a half have taught

us anything is that trying to control

the way that people move about is going

to be unsuccessful

and i see it every day is filled with

bike stations that are still filled with

95 bikes that is trying to cut down on

people from parking and all it does is

create idling and even more congestion

all that this result is go all that this

congestion pricing is going to pause as

people from new jersey it's not going to

cause them to take public transportation

it's going to cause them to try to get

into the city through the george

washington bridge which is going to back

up the rest of the manhattan that's

outside of the congestion pricing zone

it's going to back up new jersey and i

urge everybody here to please recognize

this include your remarks by state area

and reject congestion pricing thank you

===

hello this is kader rob can you hear me

yes we can

um

i am a yellow cab driver and i think um

and i'm going to speak for congestion as

a whole my my whole perspective um i

believe that the yellow cab sector

should be exempt i'm with them

protesting um and

for a number of reasons one the yellow

cab sector should be exempt because

they're mandated to be on the streets in

manhattan

um

from 96th street which is unfair and

there are people who are struggling

um

with um with this

with this surcharge and it puts a lot of

responsibility on some of these

individual medallion owners

and so

i'm speaking on their behalf and i have

other perspectives on

the congestion because congestion is a

problem in new york city

um and part of the problem is the

outdoor dining

you know some of the bus lanes on 34th

and 42nd street um but no no turn no

right turn no left turn on 30 42nd and

5th or

42nd street and 7th avenue

yes and 8th avenue and these things

are part of

de blasio and bloomberg their failure

and they created some of the congestion

and so i think um and and taxis are

paying for it and there's a limit on the

number of taxis in the city

so and also i think trucks should be

exempted because if trucks aren't

exempted the wholesale prices would go

up

thank you

===

hello

um good evening everyone my name is

sunny eng and i'm a resident of brooklyn

i'd like to voice my support for the

central business district calling

program regardless whether or not the

mta needs the funding i believe there

should be a much higher barrier for

people to drive into a place as

populated as dance as manhattan

especially given the number of public

transit options available and we didn't

know not 16 months later

i work in the hudson square area and

since the pandemic it has only gotten

worse with constant honking and idling

from car drivers trying to get into the

holland tunnel

if that's an indication of anything is

that driving is way too cheap and way

too easy in manhattan

to achieve this the pricing program

should happen 24 7. we should have no

exemptions not for city workers not for

the police and not for those who can

live in the cbd and definitely not those

who make more than the area median

income we should also adjust the

congestion charge with the various

bridge tools to prevent toll shopping

one can just look at chinatown and see

how disruptive car traffic is to the

neighborhood when commuters are driving

through canal street only to get from

new jersey to brooklyn and to avoid

paying tolls however the final income

sorry however the final outcome should

be that everyone that drives into the

cbd today will have to pay more when

this when this program is implemented

though i'm aware that this is not within

the scope of this meeting i also think

that the city should stop providing free

on-street parking period we should be

encouraging everyone to take transit

also the mta needs to provide details on

how they're going to improve service

once the program kicks in if we're

anticipating people to switch modes the

mtp the mta needs to step up and tell us

how they're going to accommodate those

who have been new to taking transit

there needs to be more bus service

especially across town routes and

downtown and off-peak service on for the

subway

also the nyc dlt needs to implement

better bus and bike infrastructure

within and outside of the cbt to adjust

to the new reality where more people

will be taking those modes of

transportation

thank you everyone and i hope you

implement this as soon as possible

===

uh yes jason anthony from the amazon

labor union

uh

again

i'm in full support of the congestion

pricing

but

with some exemptions

one

everybody has to pay their fair share

because we have seen

some elected officials

from

the central business district tolling

asking for exemptions

that should be on no

no

everybody

including jeff bezos who has a penthouse

at the

iron district

has to pay their fair share

also

those who in new jersey

has to have

a seat in the table

those who rely on the port authority

toes

also should have a seat in the table

because what happens

if the gateway tunnels collapse

the whole northeast corridor

will be

in communicated because of this

so i think the mta should have

all parties involved in the table

and no

exceptions whatsoever

so that's all i have to say thank you

very much

===

hello

he can hear you

can you hear me

yes

thank you sorry thank you for letting me

speak i'd like to make three points

please

i want to speak to the elderly

particularly elderly disabled patients

who use nyu langone health and nyu

langone orthopedic hospital for physical

therapy they are physically incapable of

navigating the subway system with their

walkers with their canes some of them

need hip replacement these elderly

patients on fixed incomes who can only

be driven in or drive in should not have

to pay for the mta on the backs

of their

meagerly fixed income

for those new yorkers with permanent

disability tags not just permanent

disabled license plates there should be

an exclusion and these people should not

have to pay because they are physically

incapable of navigating the subway

system

number two earlier tonight someone said

that drivers are wealthier that is not

true my friends and i have cars that are

16 years old we are in debt for our

higher education but we carry heavy

items into the city we could not

possibly do so and carry these heavy

items on the subway or bus

it's not fair to make drivers pay for

the mta

finally i'd like to state that people

have talked about pollution cars are

going to be mandated to become electric

in the future all cars manufactured in

this nation are going to be required to

be electric vehicles there will not be

air pollution from the electric vehicles

so air pollution should be discounted

as a factor for the future in basing um

congestion pricing

thank you very much for listening and

for your consideration

===

hi oh hi can you hear me

yes okay

hi uh thank you i've had the great

fortune of my life of living in many

places in the new york metro region um

including manhattan queens and central

jersey and i'm here to voice my strong

support um for congestion pricing it's a

really important part of raising revenue

for mass transit

it will make our streets safer it will

make our air cleaner

and it should be implemented now with a

uniform rate

because that is the fairest way to do it

everyone who decides to drive a private

motor vehicle into manhattan should be

asked to pay the same amount for that

privilege um and i i think it's

important to realize that the

overwhelming majority of commuters from

new jersey

will be exempt from this because they

are choosing to take mass transit

whether that's ferries or buses or

trains or bicycling

they the vast majority of nj transit nj

commuters will be exempt from this um i

think a couple of people have talked

about how

this should wait until gateway is done

everyone wants gateway to be done

but we should also keep in mind that

part of the reason we don't already have

a second set of tunnels under the river

is because new jersey's previous

governor decided to kill the ark tunnel

and divert that money to roads and

bridges so if the previous governor

hadn't have done that we would already

have

a second set of tubes under the hudson

so we need to finish gateway we need

congestion pricing now because it will

benefit everyone and make our streets

safer and cleaner and generate revenue

for mass transit thank you

thank you

===

hi everyone

thank you very much for giving me the

opportunity to speak

oh i can start my video great

hi um yes i am fully in support i i live

in northern new jersey um i commute

regularly to manhattan uh for the most

part i use uh trains um but occasionally

i have to drive for various reasons we

have a

uh someone we take care of who is uh in

need of medical help and their

their primary doctor is in manhattan um

so

i feel that

the opportunity to and i say opportunity

because i mean this for everyone to

collectively sort of bear this

responsibility to make the streets safer

uh to reduce traffic in one of the most

congested dangerous zones in the planet

really or certainly in this country

it's just a benefit to everybody i am

fully in support of the congestion

pricing plan as it is as was just stated

as a as a fair and equal

charge for all drivers um and and the

benefits will far outweigh you know the

the argument that eventually we're going

to have electric cars whatever we don't

have that now and we've seen things like

this discussed in my lifetime for

decades

and we're still under the burden of cars

burning fossil fuels and other vehicles

so you know the time to take action on

this is now

and again you know as someone i've also

driven professionally um in in the city

in the five boroughs i guess that i now

live out here in morris county and

this should have happened a long time

ago so now is a perfectly good time to

start this and as somebody who commutes

in and yes occasionally takes their

private car i am fully in support of

this

program

thank you very much
