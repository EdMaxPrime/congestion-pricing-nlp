good morning we can hear you okay great

good morning i'm congressman josh

gottheimer i'm very proud to represent

new jersey's fifth congressional

district and i'm here today to fight

back against new york's proposed

congestion tax under this proposed

congestion tax when new jersey commuters

drive across the gw bridge and into

midtown they'll get whacked not only

with the gwb 16 a day tall which is

ridiculous but now an additional 15

congestion tax when they drive south of

60th street that's up to 31 a day or

more in total for a nurse just to drive

to work in new york city or to see

family at a time when we all need a

comeback even more concerning unlike the

shared port authority resources from the

tolls which help both our states every

nickel of this new congestion tax will

go solely to the mta not a cent will be

shared with a path or new jersey transit

to help new jersey that's unacceptable

letting a new regressive tax on jersey

commuters who already pay a fortune to

get into the city and millions in new

york state taxes plus all of the

resources here in washington that we've

sent to new york city during the covid

crisis that's no way to make this region

stronger instead this is simply an

attempt to mooch off of new jersey also

as the mta chief financial officer said

in june the mta does not need

the congestion pricing proceeds right

now

i strongly urge you to withdraw this

proposal and work together with us

toward a more cooperative better

solution for everyone when we work

together new jersey and new york are a

tough combination to be but right now

for my district and for all new jersey

commuters and all those who need to

visit family in new york i have no other

choice but to fight back thank you so

much for having me today

===

hi

my name is robert green and i live in

the cbd

if you look up cbd and google you find

nothing but weed shops

that's because there is no such thing as

the central business district a place

where 1.3 million people live as is true

below 60th street on the island of

manhattan is anything but

it's a central living district and it

should be described as such i know that

the three generations of my family that

live here retired working and in school

deserve safe walking

safe biking and clean air just like

wherever you are coming from to drive

into the cld

that's right the cld remember that

in fact most people who drive here have

yards or areas for their kids to play in

by their house here

in the cld the city is our backyard and

yet people in cars and trucks think that

they should just be able to stomp all

over our yard and pay nothing for the

privilege please

cars should be seen as guests in the cld

and their use and abuse must be lessened

past congestion pricing with no

exemptions as soon as you can so that me

my kids and my parents and the

1.299997 million other people can all

walk bike and breathe easier thank you

===

hello uh my name is richard geraldi i

live in jersey city and before the

pandemic i commuted daily into manhattan

uh while i do own a car i primarily get

around the region by walking biking and

riding the path in subway

i'm here today to express my unequivocal

support for the central business

district totaling program in reality new

york city and the entire metro area need

to do much more than implement

congestion pricing to make the region

more livable for all of its residents

but the program is an important step and

the city state and federal government

should do everything in their power to

expedite its watch

i know a number of people are here to

oppose congestion pricing i want to urge

them including representative gotheimer

to seriously consider the benefits of

reduced traffic for drivers

reduced traffic

would decrease the amount of time you

spend in the car when you do have to

drive in and out of the city if you're a

commuter that means more time to do what

you want to do at work or at home

if you drive around to different work

sites in midtown and lower manhattan the

time saved means more jobs and more

income that would do more

that would more than offset the

additional toll the benefits for

everyone are clear and i

i fully support it thank you

===

hello can you guys see

hi

thank you for hosting this meeting and

allowing the public to provide comments

i encourage the mta and all other

institutional stakeholders across this

tri-state metropolitan region including

the port authority of new york and new

jersey to collaborate in decision making

for all not just their artificially

siloed constituencies i oppose

congestion pricing as a proposal as a

proposal and ultimately adopted by the

new york legislature ever since i was a

resident in brooklyn with an assemblyman

carroll's district unfortunately the new

york legislature decided a new fee a

euphemism for tax without determining

how to spend it

was the best idea to serve the public

what kind of governance style is it to

levy attacks without direction on how to

implement the tax no ladies and

gentlemen this isn't a banana republic

it's new york state where accountability

your government is limited at best or

non-existent at worst

proponents of congestion taxes have now

had two years to build their case for

congestion pricing the tax has to be

levied by law now we are condescended to

that is for our own good because of all

the evaluation undertaken

it is interesting that the city and

state of new york claim to care about

these issues but only see additional

taxes as a means of achieving their

aspirations something they have been

unwilling or incapable of managing for

the better part of forever

legislators and bureaucrats have chosen

to ignore effective means of reducing

congestion without extracting funds from

users it goes without saying the mta

could spend less spend its current

budget more efficiently and use other

means of congestion reduction like

using existing

tolling

infrastructure and implementing two-way

tolling on existing infrastructure

expanding traffic calming measures and

road diets and road pedestrianizing

as to promoting equity well i'm almost

done but the people that are going to

benefit the most from congestion pricing

are the wealthy manhattan residents like

the prior speaker who will be able to

extract more benefits from the city at

the cost of poor people and working

class who have to commute by car

thank you

our next speaker is corey hannigan

followed by rafael wakefield

hello can you hear me

yes we can

good morning thank you for the board for

organizing these public hearings my name

is corey hanigan i'm a new jersey native

and i'm also a city and regional

planning master's student at rutgers in

new brunswick and i'm consulting for the

njdot within the vortex transportation

center i'd like to voice my enthusiastic

support for this proposal the recent

storms and flooding show that we can no

longer ignore the devastating effects of

climate change

things will only get worse until we take

decarbonization seriously and that means

making tough choices like switching from

cars to more space efficient and

environmentally sustainable modes like

trains and buses

you know many people drive because

transit's unreliable and i understand

that but it's impossible to improve bus

service when the roads are filled to the

brim with personal cars and ride share

we cannot continue to assume driving as

a default people make choices on how to

get around based on the infrastructure

available to them

and changing the balance of incentives

could encourage many more people to

consider alternative modes alternative

times or even work remotely

private vehicles account for less than a

quarter of the total bridge crossings

into manhattan every day but they

consume the vast majority of street

space and transportation funding both in

new jersey and in new york they are also

responsible for the overwhelming

majority of transportation related

deaths and they are major sources of

local air pollutants like ground level

ozone and fine particulate matter which

are responsible for 95 of all air

pollution related deaths these

pollutants impact lung and brain

function on the day of exposure and

developmentally so that includes

everyone working in manhattan that drove

in surrounded by gas-powered cars but it

also includes a large and growing number

of new jerseyans in new jersey city and

in newark and other cities sliced

through by our highway network you know

the census showed a growth of 80 000

people in jersey city in newark alone

and these are new families that have

children that breathe the exhaustive

cars every day we drive past workers who

drive into manhattan earn significantly

more than those who take the train

especially those they drive past they're

also more likely to be white and poor

residents are less likely on a car and

overwhelming the people who live near

highways are low income and people of

color this has been implemented in

singapore amsterdam

it's a benefit for everyone i urge you

to consider the benefits of cleaner air

for all of us thank you

our next speaker is rafael wakefield

followed by lauren paterno

raphael wakefield

we're going to move forward to lauren

paterno followed by diana feinberg

raphael

we can come back to raphael wakefield

our next speaker is lauren paterno

followed by diana feinberg

good morning my name is lauren paterno

i'm speaking on behalf of aaa clubs of

new jersey which serves approximately 2

million members across the state of new

jersey

first we are grateful to the mta for

providing hearings across the regions

which will be impacted by the central

business district holding program this

is certainly a step in the right

direction to ensure the public has an

opportunity to be heard

the mta currently charges different

rates to drivers based on whether their

ezpass was issued by a new york customer

service center or some other agency the

out of state ez pass rate is more than

50 percent higher than the new york e-z

pass rate in our opinion this practice

is unfair and takes advantage of an

unsuspecting interstate drivers for

example driving one way on the henry

hudson bridge costs 7.50 for an out of

state easy pass user 4.50 more than the

new york easy pass user pays this

disparity is far higher than most other

agencies we believe the mta should not

charge differential rates to easy pest

users in the central business tolling

program

additionally in the interest of fairness

and to eliminate the practice dubbed as

bridge and tunnel shopping

any program implemented should equalize

tolls for all entrants to the pricing

zone and drivers coming into the zone

via the george washington bridge should

not be subject to a double toll lastly

we respectfully request an exemption for

service vehicles emergency vehicles tow

trucks and light duty service vehicles

all provide essential safety functions

in new york city in fact in london all

vehicles classified as recovery vehicles

are eligible for 100 discount because

those vehicles facilitate flow of

traffic by aiding and removing disabled

vehicles new york city should follow the

london model for all service and

recovery vehicles we thank you for the

opportunity to testify today

thank you

our next speaker is diana feinberg

followed by johnna chernigs

good morning uh can you hear me we can

okay thank you very much uh my name is

dianna feinberg i'm a professional

planner in new jersey

engaged for many years in development

and transportation issues in the north

jersey area i'm also speaking as a

member of the meadowlands chamber and

the fair congestion pricing alliance

i have to say i've been dismayed so far

by the lack of engagement with new

jersey during the formulation of the

congestion pricing program framework new

york new jersey and connecticut are all

part of a connected regional economy

linked by our transportation systems

the labor force and many economic ties

new jersey is also new york's largest

commuter shed

and growing commuter shed the same

people the city wants to lure back to

revive its office economy

not to mention supporting its cultural

institutions and retail businesses

however unlike the metro north and lirr

regions

new jersey has no seat on the

transportation mobility review board

which will shape the program neither

will new jersey under the current plan

receive any revenue from congestion

pricing this ignores the role that new

jersey and specifically new jersey

transit play in the regional economy and

specifically the new york city economy

so what i would like to to

ask is that new jersey be assigned beat

on the trmb pmrb

and be a full partner in evaluating and

structuring the program

in addition the environmental assessment

should address the full range of

potential social economic and

infrastructure impacts on new jersey i

understand the focus on the cbd but

there are also impacts to be examined on

this side of the river including impacts

on transit and traffic circulation and

congestion

and where the burden of tolls will fall

on new jersey's population

thank you

our next speaker is johnna chernitz

followed by zoe baldwin

hello

yes hi

hi good morning i am jana ternitz i'm

the deputy director of the tri-state

transportation campaign we appreciate

the opportunity to provide public

comment today in support of congestion

pricing tri-state is a 501c3 nonprofit

advocacy organization dedicated to

mobility accessibility equity equity and

livability in new jersey new york and

connecticut long championed by

environmental justice and transportation

advocates new york city's congestion

pricing plan is an example of a targeted

approach to reducing traffic congestion

enhancing the availability and

reliability of public transportation

improving local air quality congestion

pricing revenue will be used to

accomplish the goals of providing

modernized subway signals making the

system almost fully accessible improving

bus service and bringing metro north

trains to penn station in fact new

jersey transit commuters many of whom

transfer to mta buses and subways upon

reaching the cbd will also reap huge

benefits in the improvements funded

through congestion pricing in a recent

analysis tri-state found that the impact

on new jersey drivers is minimal as a

nominal amount of new jersey residents

actually drive into the cbd for work in

all legislative districts surveyed only

single-digit percentages of residents

work in the cbd and commute by private

vehicle across all districts an average

of 1.6 of workers will be subject to the

congestion charge public transit is the

primary mode of choice of the majority

of manhattan cbd workers in every

district that was analyzed on average

77.5 percent of manhattan cbd workers

who use public transportation to dvd

from new jersey the majority of

districts public transportation

commuters have a lower median income

than commuters who drive into

manhattan's cbd given the effect of

covet on work and commuting patterns and

more people are working from home unless

the impact on driving commuters from new

jersey is lower than the census data in

our analysis shows tri-state has been

fighting for congestion pricing for well

over a decade and now is finally within

reach we cannot afford to delay any

longer thank you

thank you

our next speaker is zoe baldwin followed

by raymond nguyen

zoe

yes hi

hi

uh good morning my name is zoe baldwin

and i'm the new jersey director for the

regional plan association a nearly 100

year old civic organization working

toward better mobility economic

opportunity and a more resilient

metropolitan region

for decades we've strongly supported

congestion pricing because we see it as

a centerpiece of a set of policies that

will lead to a greener more equitable

region however many in new jersey have

expressed valid concerns about how this

will impact drivers and communities on

this side of the hudson as a lifelong

new jersey resident i fully understand

those concerns and appear today to

reiterate the congestion pricing

benefits new jerseyans a great deal

while new jersey drivers have always

paid tolls to cross the hudson river

many from new york and connecticut have

avoided this by crossing a free city

owned crossings such as the brooklyn

bridge but with toll credits in place at

all three new jersey crossings this new

policy would level that playing field

four out of five new jersey commuters

already use transit to cross the hudson

river and congestion pricing will reduce

the traffic for that small percentage

that do need to drive into the central

business district our estimates show

that this program will decrease traffic

by about 15 percent during traffic busy

periods which is good for our commutes

our commerce and our air quality

additionally congestion pricing will

improve the city's public transportation

system which is used by a vast majority

of new jersey commuters once they cross

the river further facilitating a smooth

ride to work in 2019 rpa produced a

report that laid out recommendations for

implementation and is available on our

website at rpa.org

two of the key recommendations focused

on the need for mta to provide toll

credits to drivers at the three hudson

river crossings and to vary that fee by

the level of congestion at different

times of the day these recommendations

will eliminate unwanted traffic shifts

caused by drivers shopping for cheapest

holes and will incentivize off-peak

travel further reducing congestion

across the region

mta should incorporate these

recommendations and also analyze

localized traffic impacts in new jersey

neighborhoods the bottom line is that

congestion pricing is a big win for the

entire region and we strongly urge the

mta to consider the impacts it will have

on both sides of the hudson river and

implement it fairly and equitably thank

you

thank you

our next speaker is raymond nguyen

followed by steve corrales

hello can you hear me

yes we can

okay

this is raymond nguyen

i'm a new jersey resident

uh currently residing in newark and a

student

of the new jersey institute of

technology

majoring in industrial engineering um

with also

private interests in

urban planning and

transit related issues

having come into the city many times

by both uh

car and by transit

and having studied the matter

i would like to express my support

for the proposal and i would consider

that as

a long time in coming

the

extra the externalities which are

imposed by

the

by motor vehicles

are generally not captured and are

increasingly

not captured as

inflation has cut away at the gas tax

and vehicles have become more fuel

efficient

while new york city of course does not

dictate national policy it can at least

relieve itself from some of the

externalities that have been imposed in

its own area

including imposing long commutes on

those who actually do need private

vehicles

um

as well as potentially shaping longer

track patterns

therefore i would like to say that i

that i am supportive of the measure to

introduce congestion pricing into

uh the central business district

that is all thank you very much

thank you our next speaker is steve

carellis followed by ron cementini

i'm here

hi we can hear you

there we go this is what the screen

presents to you

um

there you go i'm steve corrales the

director of government and public

affairs for the new jersey chapter of

the national motors association a

motorist advocate advocacy organization

i've led the state chapter for close to

35 years and during that time have

commented on just about all toll matters

impacting new jersey motorists

on that note the nma joins with new

jersey federal state and local officials

to ensure that this tolling program

credits tolls paid on all bridges and

tunnels from new jersey that provide

access to the central business district

that includes the george washington

bridge

on a broader note this congestion

pricing tolling program also known as a

legalized money grab from motorists to

note the following four things

first don't convince yourself that

congestion pricing implementations in

other countries will translate well to a

program in the u.s even in new york city

you should be more realistic about the

problems that were experienced elsewhere

second the calculated costs of time and

money of congestion to businesses

commuters and residents are some of the

supposed justifications for the program

however those costs fail to take into

account that they are preferred by

motorists for the broader benefits that

driving or sharing a vehicle provides

over public transit

that has its own

problems and contributions to lost time

and

question money if congestion doesn't

improve will

uh tolls be raised further until it does

and since motorists are paying a new

cost for supposed better service what

are you going to do in conjunction with

new york city d.o.t to improve

congestion beyond anticipated price

gouging

fourth how are you going to handle toll

collection problems that aren't the

fault of motorists the state of new york

has a poor track record in that regard

in closing be very careful motorists

won't tolerate being a cash cow

if they don't see value in fairness

please conclude your remarks

thank you

thank you

our next speaker is ron simoncini

followed by michael goals

thank you for your time today i just got

a uh heard that somebody from rpa

said that

people in new jersey were diverting to

the brooklyn uh bridge for their commute

and that's all you need to know about

the credibility of rpa that's absolutely

ridiculous

what's really happening here is that new

york wants to preserve a six dollar

community for residents of new york city

on their subways and buses

and they expect new jerseyans to pay 45

a day to commute

so you talked about environmental

justice but what about the economic

justice what about the social justice of

the situation where a sitting duck in

new jersey is supposed to say i'm not

going to change my computation pattern

i'll pay 40 a day to commute or

i'll go on already full and at maximum

capacity buses uh and trains from new

jersey that's just not going to happen

that way

and you guys know it's not going to

happen that way so this whole process is

dishonest

the fact of the matter is you need 15

billion dollars to fix your stuff

because you haven't maintained it and

now you want new jerseyans to pay it in

the cost of their commute but you know

what we're going to do instead

we're going to do what we've been doing

during the pandemic we're going to stay

in new jersey

so in order for new york to have a

recovery

that's broad that's inclusive you can't

have congestion pricing because you're

going to discourage people from coming

in and doing the things that new york

needs which is bringing economic

activity back to the city

so we need to look no further than the

fact that the agency determining the

tolls is

a

bridge and tunnel

you don't have a seat at the table for

nj transit you don't have a seat at the

table for port authority of new york and

new jersey and the

incredible moment is it's port

authorities bridges and tunnels they're

bringing these riders in and you don't

have them on your on your board

this whole thing's ridiculous

everybody's been saying i appreciate the

opportunity to talk i'll give one more

take on that i don't appreciate the

opportunity to talk i resent the fact

that we're having to spend resources to

contest this ridiculous program

thank you

our next speaker is michael goals

followed by audrey kaminsky

michael goals

we will come back to michael

our next speaker is audrey kaminsky

followed by cara girl

audrey kaminsky

hi good morning can you hear me

we can

i'm not sure why the camera's not coming

on i apologize for that

um

oh here i am sorry

okay here i am sorry

okay um

so i'm actually a member of the two of

the demographics impacted i am a

resident of um southern

manhattan south of 60th i'm more precise

of southern battery park city i also

work in morristown new jersey so

i'm i would like to address many aspects

but i'm going to focus on the impact of

my neighborhood i haven't have all the

i've come to many of these meetings and

i've heard

hardly anyone address this

that southern battery park city is a

unique neighborhood we are roughly one

half mile long

and two blocks wide we are cut off from

the rest of manhattan by west side

highway

so i understand westside highway is not

going to have a pole so does that mean

we can go on west side highway enjoy a

ride around the perimeter of manhattan

but we cannot enter the rest of

manhattan so a resident in

baidai which is two blocks from me can

drive all the way to 59th and back no

penalty because it's our understanding

that if you stay within the grid you're

not penalized but those in battery park

city cannot access the rest of manhattan

you may say well why do we need to we

can take subway the closest subway here

is a half a mile and that's just a

couple lines the other ones are further

so

if you're elderly unfortunately you know

i'm mobile but a lot of elderly

residents cannot they have to take cabs

or drive themselves cabs are already

having the uh congested pricing

in their in their uh tolls so

we need more information about how this

is going to impact you know you're

talking about like this whole thing in

manhattan as if it's unified it's

our little area is unique and we need

more information the lack of

transparency is really troubling thanks

thank you

our next speaker is cara girl followed

by rafael wakefield

good morning i'm cara girl research and

communications associate at the

permanent citizens advisory committee to

the mta pcac

i'm also speaking as someone who can't

drive but as friends and family in new

jersey i frequently take the path in new

jersey transit to get there from

brooklyn and while neither option is

perfect public transit gets me where i

need to go i know that congestion

pricing will only speed up maya and so

many other ships to jersey by reducing

traffic and funding critical transit

improvements to get us to and from the

past and njt the argument that transit

doesn't get you anywhere in and out of

or to new jersey doesn't ring true

instead of trying to stop congestion

pricing from happening elected officials

west of the hudson might consider

investing that same energy and improving

their own transit systems transit riders

need congestion pricing now more than

ever it's the only feasible way to

substantially raise funding for the mta

without raising ferris it'll bring in a

steady stream of money for key

improvements to the region's transit and

commuter rail far beyond the five

boroughs

facing coveted and worse than climate

change the additional billions of

dollars from congestion pricing could

not be more important for rise for

riders coming from jersey and beyond and

for those who still choose to drive

it'll help speed up the trip

particularly relevant this climate week

the environmental benefits of congestion

pricing cannot be understated as we

learn from historic storms and flooding

this summer the mta needs significant

funding to build a more resilient

regional transit system that can

withstand the forces of extreme weather

congestion pricing will bring the

billions of dollars we need to repair

our transit while also improving air

quality decreasing traffic around the

metropolitan area and making the region

less car dependent

constant bumper to bumper traffic can be

a thing of the past improving quality of

life and commutes all over the region we

deserve reliable and frequent service

across our subways buses and commuter

rail and finally thanks to congestion

pricing the 21st century transit system

our 21st century region desperately

needs is insight thank you

thank you our next speaker is rafael

wakefield followed by michael goals

let me know

yes we can hear you great okay my name

is rafael wakefield i live in jersey

city

thank you for giving me another chance

to get connected my message to the

federal highway administration is that

this outreach is a waste of time and far

too extensive stop wasting time and

money soliciting complaints from cranks

all the way to pennsylvania the dually

elected new york state legislature has

passed this legislation and should be

locked enacted without delay there

should be no exemptions for anyone

beyond what is mandated by federal law

except for taxis working in new york

city today the excessive traffic backs

up through the holland tunnel and into

jersey city the walking riding and

biking public has taken enough abuse as

far as the objections raised regarding

new jersey specifically these never get

around to blaming the actual villain

which is the unaccountable undemocratic

port authority that prioritizes cars

even as a buses language in the george w

george washington bridge and the lincoln

tunnel the state of affairs is

ridiculous it's unacceptable no other

major city in the world the developing

world developed world anyway works this

way for good reason it's it's moronic we

deserve to have a life without constant

honking and constant car congestion and

not cater to the tiny minority of people

driving into and out of manhattan thank

you

thank you

please note if you are registered to

speak and have not heard your name

please enter it into the q a chat now

again

if you are a registered speaker you

pre-registered for this webinar and you

have not heard your name

please include it in the q a chat box

our next speaker

is michael goals

so can you hear me

yes we can hear you please speak up

yes my name is michael golds i'm a

supporter of the fair congestion pricing

alliance here in new jersey and one of

my main concerns is that you cite on

your website the mta

and we do support congestion pressures

because we we need

cleaner streets we need cleaner air and

all that stuff but

what you do say on your website you cite

london you cite singapore and you cite

all the other cities that have

successfully uh instituted congestion

pricing yet those cities had already

improved their public transit before

instituting congestion pricing so as i

am a commuter and i do commute

frequently in and out of the city i know

that there are

major major major problems with

infrastructure not only with new jersey

transit but with the mta with the buses

and with the subways and everything else

so until there's major major upgrades to

the system i don't see how

any congestion pricing fee tax scheme

whatever you want to call it is going to

help improve a system that's already

failing on its own you you need to

improve the system first to then shift

the transit the of the community people

to public transit in order to free up

the roads and until you do that i fear

that this is a disaster waiting to

happen you're just going to clog up the

roads even more

and new jersey transit does not have the

capacity so therefore

these tolls if suggested should also be

shared with new jersey so new jersey

improve their public transit and we can

get congestion prices to the goal that

is what it's supposed to do right now as

it stands new jersey needs a seat at the

table the federal government needs to

step in and oversee the process so every

party involved is treated equitably

thank you

thank you
