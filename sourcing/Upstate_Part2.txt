all right can you hear me

yes we can

great

good evening my name is ken zabrowski i

represent the 96th district in new york

state assembly in rockland county i

testify tonight in defense of rocklin

and the west of the hudson commuters in

general

despite being in the mta district and

paying all the same taxes as our

neighbors on the east side of the hudson

river our commuting options pale in

comparison our trains are run by new

jersey transit who consistently has

substandard service and we have no

one-seat ride into manhattan the train

option is often times a long train ride

on a single track down into new jersey

only to have to find another method over

the river thus many rocklanders

especially those traveling off-peak are

forced to drive into the city while

considering this congestion pricing

scheme you may legitimately be able to

ask constituents in westchester or long

island that they can take the train to

avoid the toll you can't tell my

commuters that the unacceptable message

to west of the hudson communities is you

must shoulder the full burden of this

toll commuters coming from new jersey

through the tunnels will see an offset

commuters coming from rockland using the

gw bridge will not that's patently

unfair

secondly this entire process amazes me

article after article is written about

how kobit 19 may have fundamentally

changed our economy how businesses are

moving to remote work options how

commercial real estate may be going

through a dramatic shift how new york

city attractions are worried that

visitors may not return

yet we think that congestion pricing

cash grabs immune from these shifts if

anything an additional 23 toll is all

the more reason to stay away by the time

my folks pay the gw toll and congestion

pricing toll and the outrageous parking

fees

they have spent close to 100 before

having the privilege of spending money

in new york city business if i was one

of those businesses i'd be looking at

this plan as one more barrier to

rebuilding the city postcovid and would

scare me to death

instead we should be recognizing and

fostering or fostering our symbiotic

relationship in the metro area we in the

suburbs benefit from new york city and

new york city benefits from us at this

time of great economic uncertainty

punishing suburban

residents for the privilege of

participating in the new york city

economy is unsound policy thank you

===

well sorry about that good evening my

name is walter zuller i'm speaking as a

member of the metro north railroad

commuter council

and as a long-time westchester resident

who travels regularly on metro north

traffic congestion is a very serious

problem in manhattan and beyond

heavy air pollution reduced quality of

life and excessive extensive delays can

all be mitigated through congestion and

pricing it's only fair to require

drivers to bear more of the cost of our

streets to make our region healthier

safer and better for everyone

congestion crisis will help us avoid a

grim reality for the future of mta

federal emergency funding will drive up

dry up sooner than we are prepared for

without a long-term strategy like

congestion pricing everyday subway bus

and commuter rail riders will take the

hit

the billion dollar was bonded to 15

billion dollars brought in annually by

congestion pricing are more than just

crucial they will be the lifeblood of

the entire new york city metropolitan

area

with congestion pricing metro north can

become the best option for even more

westchester and other hudson valley

residents

projects like repairing and making more

stations ada accessible extending metro

north to penn station and adding four

more stations in the bronx making the

critical track signal and power upgrades

along the harlem hudson and new haven

lines as well as the west of hudson

service will ensure that our communities

have safe reliable and efficient service

public transit is already the most

environmentally friendly form of

transportation and we have to make sure

that we're prepared to face worsening

climate change and extreme weather by

funding critical infrastructure

improvements in the region

congestion pricing with few exemptions

is the only feasible way to raise

funding for essential improvements to

metro north

thanks to congestion pricing the

transfer system we desperately need is

in sight and to my fellow westchester

residents i say take metron off the next

time you go down to the city you'll have

a more relaxing trip while helping to

make our entire region stronger than

ever thank you

thank you

===

good evening and thanks for taking the

time to listen to feedback about

congestion pricing i have two points

that i want to make tonight first of all

the concept of congestion pricing is

reasonable and if it's implemented

fairly it could bring benefits by

raising the cost of driving into lower

manhattan it could discourage

unnecessary car trips and reduce

pollution helping lower our state's

carbon emissions by providing a new

stream of revenue for the mta it could

help rebuild and expand our mass transit

system

however for my constituents in rockland

county congestion pricing will be a raw

deal if changes aren't made rockland

county residents lack access to

convenient and fast mass transit options

particularly we have no one-seat ride to

new york city in contrast to my

constituents in westchester and hundreds

of thousands of commuters in new jersey

and long island yet rockland's

businesses pay the mta payroll tax and

our residents pay an extra 0.375 percent

sales tax on all of our purchases to

help fund the mta meanwhile the value of

the services actually provided to

rocklin's commuters have consistently

been far below the cost of the taxes

that rockland pays into the mta system

many estimates have continually put that

value gap between what rockland pays and

what we get to be approximately 40

million dollars so when congestion

pricing goes into effect those who live

in northern new jersey who can't afford

the fees will switch to taking nj

transit to penn station those living on

long island will take the lirr directly

to grand central and riders from

westchester putnam duchess and even

fairfield county connecticut can take a

one-seat ride directly into new york

city via the metro north what will

rocklin have still a 40 million deficit

uh 40 million value deficit with tens of

millions of additional fees to pay since

our residents can't catch a direct train

into the city and must pay 12 to 16

dollars just to enter manhattan via the

george washington bridge or other

crossings this is completely unfair when

this program is implemented it must be

done equitably based on access to public

transportation until a one-seat ride

into manhattan is available for rockland

county it's imperative that rockland

residents are credited for the cost of

tolls already paid to enter manhattan

otherwise commuters will face literally

thousands of dollars a year in

additional costs with no viable

transit as an alternative

===

can you hear me now

yes we can

okay good um

[Music]

i'm assembly member amy paulin

as corporations authorities

and commissions chair i served as a

member of the metropolitan

transportation sustainability advisory

work group we were charged with

assessing the problems and coming up

with solutions to the dire straits of

the mta system

the amount of work necessary to repair

and improve the subways and commuter

rails is enormous and we quickly

realized we needed the creation of a

stable funding source

faced with this reality the work group

made the difficult decision to recommend

central business district tolling which

will provide 15 billion dollars for

capital improvements to the mta system

all residents of the mta region benefit

from a robust and reliable transit

system

residents within the central business

district will especially benefit from

reduction in harmful emissions when

there are fewer cars on the road each

every discount credit or exemption

granted takes away from this goal and

means one less project can be completed

they should be granted very sparingly if

at all

metro north has a long list of projects

that are needed to maintain and improve

service to our communities including new

rolling stock a third track for the

harlem line ada accessibility penn state

access pen station access project um one

seat ride for rockland we must do

everything we can to ensure that the

full amount of funding from central

business district tolling is realized so

these critical projects can move forward

thank you

===

okay

daniel you may begin your remarks

great hello

my name is daniel convesor i'm the

director of bike tarrytown for an

advocacy organization to promote the

economy and health of the two villages

of tarrytown and sleepy hollow

by improving transportation options

so

we are in strong favor of the congestion

pricing program and we wish it would

start way sooner

but of course that's not directly under

the mta's control

i hope our

federal delegation can help move this

along faster somehow

the funds are much needed for

mta improvements

and mobility improvements and it would

be great if some of these funds could be

used to improve

direct bus service and get bus lanes on

highways for our

constituents our friends in rockland

county

so they can get a fast one-seat ride to

the city

and as uh assembly member poland pointed

out it is

important not to have

exemptions

and credits uh

it defeats the purpose

we really need to have a strong robust

expensive program for people driving

because driving exacts huge

costs on our

region uh for the people living in it

for the businesses living in it uh all

the delays and pollution

are a huge harm for everybody in the

region especially folks living right

next to the cbd

thank you so much

===

hi can you hear me

yes we can great thank you um good

evening my name is melissa kaplan-macy

and i'm vice president for state

programs for the regional plan

association a nearly 100 year old civic

organization working for mobility

economic opportunity affordable housing

and a more resilient new york city

metropolitan region i'm also a resident

of westchester county

for decades we have strongly supported

congestion pricing because we think it

is a centerpiece of a set of policies

that will lead to a greener more

equitable region

done right congestion pricing reduces

driver delays improves transit and

reduces air pollution both in and out of

the charging zone

suggestion pricing will raise vital

revenue for public transit and 100 of

this net revenue will go into paying for

improvements to our public

transportation system

most westchester county commuters to

manhattan ride transit less than three

percent drive to work in the congestion

pricing zone

westchester county residents will

benefit from better transit and reduce

traffic when they go into manhattan

below 60th street

congestion pricing will reduce traffic

congestion traffic congestion causes

crashes and injuries air pollution and

hurts our economic recovery we need

tools to manage it especially since

traffic is already surpassing

pre-covered levels for westchester

residents driving into manhattan our

estimates show that congestion pricing

will mean a 10 to 15

increase in traffic speeds during busy

periods

congestion pricing will make the

transportation system more equitable

this will benefit lower income

households who don't own a car and rely

on transit because owning a car is

expensive

regional plan association produced a

thorough report in 2019 that analyzed a

number of total toll scenarios and laid

out recommendations for implementation

it is available for all to read on our

website at rpa.org

key recommendations from the report are

as follows

implement transit and bicycle

improvements prior to starting

congestion pricing

adopt specific objectives and metrics to

meet traffic environmental and health

goals and ensure that benefits are

equally shared and i'll skip the rest

but thank you so much um for the two

minutes um and for your time tonight

===

here i am

can i

we can hear can you hear me

you can begin your remarks

daniel i believe you're muted now oh i'm

sorry

um i certainly am

uh good evening my name is daniel herbst

i'm a

westchester resident

i've been an avid motorcyclist uh for 30

years

and i think that uh

two-wheel vehicles

can go a long way toward

promoting the stated purpose

of uh congestion pricing

that stated goal is uh to improve the

transit system and reduce congestion

it doesn't take into account however the

fact that granting fuel-efficient

congestion-reducing vehicles such as

motorcycles and scooters anything less

than 100 percent uh exemption would run

counter that stated objective

uh motorcyclists should get an exemption

from congested congestion pricing and

here's why

they're incrementally better

than cars

we're trying to restrict with the high

toll they take up far less space than

regular cars especially suvs that

dominate our roads and cause a

disproportionate amount of carnage as

well

uh the wheelbase for example the heavy

suburban is almost 11 feet while the

wheelbase of my motorcycle is

five feet um additionally um it's legal

in new york state for motorcycles to

ride to a breso again that

reduces congestion

so in short

you know you can get

eight motorcycles or other two-wheel

vehicles into the space of one

suv

so for me coming into the city by

motorcycle is convenient and economic

and

the footprint is

is small so i think the use of all two

wheels

===

is everything working all right

yes we can hear you so i'm brendan

heaney i've lived in bronxville my

entire life

and i take the train to school and i'm

here to support congestion pricing so

new york city has given up so much for

us and we've given up nothing for them

every year

they restaurants lose out on billions of

dollars in revenue because of road space

given to westchester cars instead of

them new york city spends millions of

dollars on maintaining roads that we

damage

dozens of people die especially children

in lower income areas because we have to

take our dangerous cars into new york

city

so and this isn't even mentioning

pollution which

undoubtedly harms millions of lives

every year

so now we have to so now even if you

just want to focus on westchester then

this is still the best plan even if

transit isn't as good as it could be

that's even more reason to support this

the 10 percent of the funds that will go

to metro north could send

hudson line trains into penn station it

could bring back tappan zee commuter

rail ideas it could give rockland county

a one seat trip to manhattan

so

then i'd also like to say that

we shouldn't even be holding these

meetings we're spending years in

bureaucracy environmentally reviewed

studies for a project that we know is

good for the environment if this was

happening in europe the moment they

decided to have congestion pricing they

would have started work on it and it

would have been implemented by the end

of the year the these meetings being

held is a policy failure although i do

support the idea of congestion pricing

thank you

===

hi can you hear me

yes we can

hi uh my name is jeremy i live in

yonkers um

and uh and i'm commenting today to

in support of um

of congestion pricing um

until

until recently i was commuting into

manhattan every day via

via via metro north or via subway and

bus and

and even to this day uh when

when i do need to enter into new york

city it's always through transit

even even here in in our region um there

we need to be supporting transit and

reducing car use as much as possible

and as other speakers have mentioned we

need to keep exemptions to a minimum

because

because uh not not only does it

undermine the project um

that that small that small amount that

maybe you will

need to drive is then forced to pay

is forced to pay more so

so the echo the equitable thing to do

overall it is to make sure this

this passes with minimal exemption so

so once again um once again uh we need

congestion pricing we need it asap um

any electeds from

from westchester auckland or other areas

who may be listening i hope

i hope this push i hope this is an

encouragement in

in our regions to improve the bus

connections and other car reduction

strategies um

locally as well to

to tie the regions together stronger um

so let's uh let's get it done uh thank

you

===

good

evening my name is brian howell i speak

in support of a congestion pricing

program with no exemptions much has been

made at the cost those who choose to

drive into the city will have to pay but

little attention is given to the cost of

the free-for-all that now exists on our

streets costs we all pay when not with

money with our time our anger our health

and sometimes even with our lives i grew

up next to an eight-lane highway it's no

surprise that i was diagnosed with

asthma a condition i still have when the

company i worked for went out of

business i lost my health insurance and

the cost of my asthma medication was

four thousand one hundred sixty one

dollars and ninety six cents a year over

four thousand dollars a year because

people could drive fifty feet from my

childhood home in 2016 that cost was six

thousand seven hundred and fifty three

asthma hospitalizations of new york city

children last month the cost was 25

lives across the metro region lost to

hurricane ida the storm exacerbated by

climate change a threat whose key

contributors transportation emissions

largely from cars and trucks because so

much of our built environment is given

over the cars rain weather cannot be

easily absorbed into the ground the cost

thousands of homes flooded last month

but many more in the decades to come as

extreme weather events like ida become

more frequent

in 2018 205 new yorkers were killed in

traffic crashes in 2019 that number rose

to 220. last year the cost and lies of

unfeathered driving was 243 new yorkers

and through september 14th of this year

that number is already up another 26

the cost more parents will never come

home more babies killed on sidewalks

more teachers who will never again

inspire their students many have asked

for exemptions but i ask them to

consider the costs we need workers pay

every day because congestion pricing

doesn't exist yet the costs we pay in

illnesses like asthma the cost we pay in

noise the cost we pay in a warming more

extreme and more destructive climate and

more than anything the cost we pay with

our lives i asked the mta of the courage

to create a congestion pricing program

with no exemptions to act in the best

interest of us all even when our wisdom

and empathy fail us thank you

===

can you hear me

yes we can

thank you for the opportunity to speak

my name is chris hayward i live in

brooklyn and work in the cbd in other

meetings i have commented on the various

benefits that congestion pricing would

provide in terms of making our streets

safer reducing emissions of greenhouse

gases and other pollutants and

alleviating the incessant honking and

vehicle noise from which those of us who

work or live in the cbd suffer

i will not rehash those points tonight i

have also described how the proposed

toll charges are much too low and that

they do not reflect the true cost of

congestion due to externalities which

has been estimated to be greater than

100 dollars per trip a significant

component

a significant component of this true

cost is the monetary value of the delays

that congestion causes for all other

road users given this if i were a

hypothetical resident of a suburb of new

york city or beyond who had no other

option than to drive into the cbd i

would still support congestion pricing

because of the following reasons a

congestion toll will inevitably cause

some individuals to choose alternate

options to travel into manhattan thereby

reducing the overall congestion as is of

course the goal of the program

consequently my commute time would be

lessened if i made slightly above the

minimum income threshold above which one

would be subject to congestion pricing

sixty thousand dollars my effective

hourly wage would be roughly thirty

dollars per hour thus if a congestion

pricing charge of say ten dollars shaved

more than 20 minutes off my total

round-trip commute time it would be

financially worthwhile in terms of the

monetary value of my time

we all trade time for money and pay

money to save time and congestion

pricing is in this sense no different

than hiring someone to cut one's lawn or

to pay one's house for example

of course this calculation ignores the

very real psychological pain caused by

sitting in traffic day in and day out

based on real world examples such as

london and economist models the time

savings for a typical commuter who

drives into the cbd from a suburb will

be greater than 20 minutes and many of

these individuals have effective hourly

wages well in excess of thirty dollars

per hour for such individuals including

many people listening tonight supporting

supporting congestion pricing

thank you

===

yes i'm so sorry for the delay in that

um thank you for letting me take the

time to speak

i have lived in new york most of my life

i have been a motorcyclist for 27 years

and i would like to speak on behalf of

exemptions for motorcyclists and

scooters

every major city in the world

that adopted congestion pricing has an

exemption for motorcycles

they have done this based on research

and statistics

why

they recognize that motorcycles take up

a fraction of the space that cars and

certainly much less than suvs and trucks

do

both while they are in motion and when

they are parked

in motion you can almost think about

motorcycles like uh fish swimming

they're they're much more adaptable

and parked you can park 10 motorcycles

for every suv that parks

simply put

motorcycles solve the problem of

congestion

likewise motorcycles and scooters

get excellent mileage if your concern is

environmental justice

then you should support them they weigh

less they create much less wear and tear

on the roads

and

motorcyclists are both licensed and

insured they are the only two wheeled

vehicles actually riding anywhere that

have both of those qualities going on

finally with regard to the idea of

vision zero while motorcyclists pose

some danger to themselves

the number of uh

other people killed by motorcyclists is

in the single digits

in the entire state of new york uh

annually year in year year out

so

motorcycles are the solution and i ask

for an exemption for them for all of

these reasons thank you for listening

===

thank you very much my name is elena

wilson i live in brooklyn uh we need

this asap and we need it to work by

minimizing exemptions

um

motor vehicles don't just make manhattan

hostile for pedestrians bicycle riders

and motorists themselves they also make

it deadly and that doesn't have to be

our reality

every day mta and other bus riders are

mired in traffic those riders include

many low-income and essential workers

who deserve world-class bus service but

that's incompatible with current volumes

of traffic

subway riders deserve accessible

stations with elevators

so please please please

you know move this forward

intact and as quickly as possible

in terms of

rockland county the rockland county

website lists five companies that

provide direct one-seat service to

manhattan and i share the broad interest

expressed by others here in expanding

that service and improving it thank you

thank you

===

okay i'm sorry i'm the president of

passengers united uh good evening

and uh i am in support of congestion

pricing i feel we need congestion

pricing in new york city um so we need

the seven train extended to new jersey

the mta should control the nassau county

bus

and i feel that the pat train should be

free

yellow cab should get an exemption of

tolls and i also feel that the mt should

provide 25 of funding from congestion

pricing to new jersey and connecticut

it's only fair because we're asking

other states to pay for our problems and

i also feel that the nassau county buses

should be taken over again by the mta um

and i also feel that you know we need

more infrastructure as far as these

meetings are concerned i feel that a lot

of people cannot find where these

meetings are on the website and a lot of

people don't even know about these

meetings so i feel that these meetings

should be in public and that it should

be extended and this congestion pricing

process should be taken very slowly so

that there's no litigation from new

jersey

connecticut or any of the other states

um i feel it's not fair that a lot of

people are being asked to pay 39 to

enter new york city

but at the same time i support

congestion pricing because it's going to

relieve a lot of the pollution in our

air it's going to make our city better

and it's actually going to provide a lot

of funding for mass transit however like

the chairman of the mte said this has to

be done right

and it has to be a very slow process so

that there's no litigation and no one

feels that their voices was not hurt so

in closing uh passengers united supports

congestion pricing and again i want to

say thank you for letting me speak today

===

good evening my name is kendra hems and

i am president of the trucking

association of new york as a trucking

industry we share concerns about the

impacts of congestion in an annual

survey of trucking companies and drivers

from across the nation the impact of

congestion consistently ranks among

the top ten critical usage

while congestion impacts all users the

truck industry is uniquely impacted it

increases motor carrier operating costs

through wasted fuel increased labor

costs vehicle wear and tear and puts

additional stress on professional

drivers as available on duty and driver

hours are spent sitting in traffic

studies on congestion calculates annual

congestion costs of the trucking

industry to be over 63 billion dollars

and in this region specifically

congestion costs equate to six hundred

and thirty thousand dollars per mile to

the trucking industry so while we agree

that congestion must be addressed we do

have some serious concerns about the

proposed central business district

holding program

first and foremost we cannot continue to

look at trucks as the root cause of

congestion as this is simply not the

case

trucks are entering the proposed tolling

zone because they have to delivering

food fuel building supplies medical

supplies and pharmaceuticals including

the life-saving covered vaccine

drugs may be a symptom of the congestion

issue but they are not the cause

so a couple of our primary concerns the

traffic mobility review board was

supposed to make recommendations for a

variable pricing structure to our

knowledge members of that board have

never been named there's been no notice

or discussion making it difficult to

determine true impact of the proposal

we're concerned that the toll

collections must ensure annual revenues

legislated at 15 billion dollars if the

program is truly successful

in reducing congestion it becomes a

declining source of revenue we're

concerned about future total increases

we don't know how the toll will be

charred

there are so many questions and we have

concerns about the overall impact of the

industry um as i said we understand the

need to address congestion and

congestion but we want to ensure that

it's done in a fair and equitable manner

for the trucking industry thank you

===

yes i'm sorry i'm getting the small

screen can you hear me

we can hear you

okay um arthur jerry cremer

i'm a former state assemblyman and chair

of the ways and means committee

um i am representing the hunts point

cooperative market

we send approximately 600 vehicles a day

to new york city

we have 4 000 employees in the hunts

point market and it is the largest food

market in the world

the trucks

are different ones that go to the city

the smaller vendors will have to make

multiple trips to the city the larger

vendors can make

the minimum required in order to get

their products in we serve the bodegas

the delis every conceivable restaurant

you can imagine in the five boroughs

plus the suburban regions the problem we

face is that

these costs are going to be passed on to

the consumer if we can afford to do it

the smaller vendors may be forced out of

business we are a tenant of the city of

new york and pay rent to the city the

hunts point market also in addition to

the cooperative market which is meat and

provisions there's also a produce market

and a fish market

if there's no special arrangement made

for the hunts point market which is the

only city market in the region there's a

good likelihood that a number of our

smaller members will go out of business

because they won't be able to pass the

course on to their

buyers

this is a crisis for the market

we were the largest market in the world

i want to assure you that without

special consideration being made of the

market this will have this will be an

economic tornado for the members of the

market we're asking you that you

recognize that the hunts point market is

an exceptional case and that the mta and

the panel should consider what its needs

are and try to come up with a solution

that will keep this market in business

thank you for giving me your time

===

yes

okay

i i think i'm here okay um

um i'm a resident of rothland county the

second fastest growing county in new

york state i am also an environmentalist

and recognize that cars are the biggest

contributor

of greenhouse gases in the u.s

in new york state and in rockland

um some people who commute into new york

city from rockland do attempt to take

public transit

if they live close enough to the new

hudson link buses they take that service

across the cuomo bridge hook up with a

metro north train and go into grand

central

they are the lucky ones anyone who wants

to go to the west side and lives near

the one train the one train line

can do so and transfer in hoboken

um to the path train to the world trade

center

they um

there are also eight bus routes

um that go into port authority but they

are

extremely poor

and i won't go into the detail because i

don't have time

but um they were um eliminated during

covid they're come coming back on a very

limited basis i'm a big advocate for

public transit

um

but in my

perspective in a suburb that is

underserved by public transit it will be

extremely difficult to get people out of

their cars

and onto public transit

rothen county gets a quarter

of a voice in

the mta board and i think we

that needs to be looked at again

so we can get some

funding for public transit in in

rockland i believe in the subway subways

the

metro north trains they should get their

share but we should get some share more

in rockland county as well

thank you
