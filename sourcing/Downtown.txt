thanks very much i'm assembly member

deborah glick representing part of lower

manhattan

thanks for the opportunity to share some

thoughts on the central business

district tolling program i support the

goal of reducing congestion air

pollution

and to secure funding for mass transit

which is the best way to get around town

since my constituents live in the zone

they will experience the program

differently than others the majority of

my constituents don't own cars but those

who do primarily use them to leave town

and return home not to drive around the

city

so the hours of operation whether they

can

reasonably adjust or plan their travel

to avoid being penalized matters a great

deal it is if it's rush hour or a

blanket 6 a.m to 9:00 to 11 p.m that

would make it difficult to avoid

how cars leaving the west side highway

or the F.D.R.

and how they'll be captured is important

and if there is a daily cap on the fee

so leaving the highway and needing to

drive around the block

will not trigger more than one charge

understanding that will be important all

residents of the zone will feel added

costs from any delivery or service calls

from plumbers or painters etc

then other city

residents and travel to airports will

also be more costly just living here

will cost people more whether they can

afford it or not and whether or not they

have a car

so i understand there may be a threshold

for a tax credit uh

60,000 may be too low maybe for

residents a discount or one free trip

each month will help to mitigate all the

additional costs they'll endure and

finally i would like to just say that

people needing daily medical treatments

in our great hospitals who have to go

for a week at a time every day need

consideration a medical easy pass should

be developed that's time limited and

renewable so that these

uh just so that we don't

penalize people who are seriously ill

good evening i'm state senator brad

hoylam and i represent the 27th district

my district is almost nearly entirely

subsumed by the boundaries of the

central business district tolling

program i'm proud to be a long time

champion of congestion pricing

at the outset i want to say that i

strongly support the inclusion of a

manhattan resident preferably someone

who lives within the pricing zone on the

traffic mobility review board and i

would urge the MTA

and the traffic mobility review board to

consult our local community boards for

the siding of gantries and toll cameras

necessary for the implementation of the

program we need congestion pricing now

without further delay congestion pricing

is important to address the harmful

impact of vehicle emissions on public

health and the environment

it's forecast to save up to 100 million

dollars in health cost savings annually

we need congestion pricing to improve

the safety of our streets as you're well

aware new york is in the middle of a

street safety crisis

and we need congestion pricing to help

fund and be a lifeline for our

struggling mass transit system um as a

public official who represents over

100,000 constituents in the zone i

appreciate the framework and enacting

legislation which included a toll-free

perimeter around the

west side highway and the F.D.R. uh it's a

good starting point but in the senate uh

i'm introducing assemblymember harvey

epstein's legislation that would

establish a total exemption for

residents within the zone whose

income is equal or less to 120 percent of the

ami also we have to pay special

attention to ensure that disabled new

yorkers aren't disadvantaged by

congestion pricing

and the tmrb should consider additional

limited exemptions to improve the

current framework i urge the tmrb to

examine london's successful pricing

scheme to help determine possible

exemptions or fee reductions for

residents within the pricing zone mopeds

electric vehicles and patients and staff

of hospitals and medical institutions

seven of which are located in my senate

district alone uh finally um the

variable pricing scheme as it is in london uh to

help ensure that pricing uh is fair and

communicated in a timely fashion uh

thank you very much for this opportunity

uh we would

want to also ensure that the tmrb

consider a tracking dashboard so that

the program can be transparent and held

accountable thank you so much uh for

allowing me to speak for to continue to

collaborate thanks so much

i'm assembly member richard gottfried my

district includes much of the central

business district i support congestion

pricing and voted for the law

to implement it it will reduce traffic

and noise and improve air quality and

street safety the funds raised for the

mta will increase transit accessibility

and modernize our system

i have several recommendations

the mta's continual financial crises

plus the health and economic impacts of

congestion of congestion

highlight the need for quick

implementation

i support surge pricing during periods

of high traffic

these should be varied based on the

vehicle on a vehicle's weight and

emissions

the board should consult with community

boards in the affected areas and along

the borders of the cbd

regarding the sighting of the toll

cameras

the board should include a resident of

the cbd to represent those most affected

by congestion pricing

i support examining exempting all

residents of the cbd with incomes at or

below 120

of the area median income electric and

other low emission vehicles should be

exempt or at least have a discounted

toll

but this should be phased out as

electric vehicles

become more affordable

scooters and electric bicycles should be

exempt

all vehicles transporting people with

permanent and temporary disabilities

should be exact i urge the board to

consult with disability advocates to

ensure that the program is equitable i

look forward to swift implementation

thank you

===

i'm okay yes can you hear me yes we can

oh great my name is howard babich i live

in the chelsea section of manhattan i'm

a resident of the penn south cooperative

development

um we have in penn south many many of

the residents who own cars and as you

can imagine none of us are happy with

this plan

um

we um

while we are basically we have problems

with the overall

program um the specifics with regarding

to exemptions is what really is of

interest to us we would like

and i know that the state is planning a

60 thousand dollar

persons with their families with 60 000

or less be exempted we think that's not

enough we think everyone who lives in

the district should be exempted we don't

feel that we should visit families on

holidays outside the district and have

to pay what's basically a ransom to get

home it's it's absurd

um

why we can't have the same rights as

other americans and own a car is beyond

me

um

and the plan itself seems to be

contradictory while you want to raise

money for the mta and reduce congestion

it seems to contradict each other if you

raise the money

well then you're not releasing you have

enough people coming in so there's still

going to be congestion and if you do

reduce congestion who's going to be

paying the money that's going to go for

the mta so it seems to contradict itself

also senator schumer stated a couple of

weeks ago that the infrastructure bill

that's before the

house now

has 10 billion dollars for the mta so

why does the mta need this money now

um

also if you go back to this to the

city's first report i believe it was

called move new york the city stated

that it the city itself is responsible

for congestion by not enforcing parking

regulations and for all the construction

so why should the motorists have to be

penalized for something that the city

admits it's its own fault thank you very

much

===

good evening my name is kate slevin and

i'm executive vice president for the

regional plan association a nearly 100

year old civic organization working for

better mobility economic opportunity

affordable housing and a more resilient

new york city metropolitan region for

decades we have strongly supported

congestion pricing because we think it

is a centerpiece of a set of policies

that will lead to a greener more

equitable region i've personally

supported congestion pricing for almost

20 years while living in apartments

across the tri-state area and working

jobs in manhattan and brooklyn and i've

also been a car owner for most of this

time congestion pricing will reduce

traffic congestion traffic congestion

causes crashes and injuries air

pollution and hurts our economic

recovery we need tools to manage it

especially since traffic is already

surpassing pre-covid levels

congestion pricing will raise vital

revenue for public transit and 100 of

this net revenue will go into paying for

improvements to our public

transportation system

congestion pricing will make the

transportation system more equitable the

majority of households in new york city

don't even own cars because owning a car

is expensive and they rely exclusively

on transportation public transportation

walking cycling and other ways of

getting around

regional plan association produced a

thorough report in 2019 they analyzed a

number of toll scenarios and laid out

recommendations for implementation it's

available for all to read on our website

at rpa.org some of the key

recommendations include implementing

transit and break improvements prior to

starting congestion pricing adopting

specific objectives and metrics to meet

traffic environmental and health holes

and ensure those benefits are equitably

shared and creating a consistent toll

rate for all similar trips by providing

toll credits to drivers at mta river

crossings to reduce shopping for the

cheapest tolls we have found that 25 of

morning traffic on the bqe for example

is avoiding tools on the hugh cary

tunnel to take advantage of the free

east river bridges um introducing

two-way tolling and conjunct the

congestion zone is also something we

support

congestion fee by the level of

congestion at different times of day we

hope you take these recommendations into

account and we're very eager to see this

program move forward thank you very much

===

good evening my name is jessica murray

i'm a member of the

elevator action group with rise and resist

and i'm the chair of the advisory

committee for transit accessibility for

new york city transit

um i support congestion pricing because

we need funds to

go to improving accessibility in the

subway

but i also think that uh people who need

a card to still get around because

they have consistent difficulty with

non-existent or broken elevators should

not have to pay a congestion fee

um there are probably not that many

people who drive their own vehicle or

have a family member drive them in the

central business district and need to

travel during peak times so the

exemption for qualifying vehicles

uh transporting a person with a

disability should include person of

vehicles

and any concerns about fraud should be

backed up by an analysis of travel

patterns for disabled parking placard

holders and evidence of fraud and the

existing parking placard program

meanwhile actual fraud in the form of

defaced and obscured license plates is

currently costing the mta total revenue

and rampant placard abuse is also

contributing to congestion and should be

addressed thank you

===

can you hear me okay i don't know why

the video is not working but okay i'm

gale brewer manhattan boat president and

i want to uh support congestion pricing

i know that it will reduce the gridlock

improve air quality

street safety and help fund our city's

transit system

in 2020 we had

too many crashes 4579 

too many and i know that the mta has

reported that the city's bridge and

tunnel traffic has already reached

pre-covid levels which is why we need

to have congestion pricing

i also want to say that the

five-year 55 billion capital plan it

talks about purchasing new trains and

old signals being fixed up and

renovating subway stations for ada but

as i understand it only 2 billion out of

the 55 billion is currently funded so

that's when i was in the city council i

did vote for congestion pricing so i

have a long history all the way back to

2008. i certainly have received a lot of

emails from people who are concerned and

i can understand who do not

want congestion pricing but i think it's

the only way

other cities stockholm has

successfully implemented it london has

successfully implemented we need to have

new bus

new bus lanes

new bike lanes so that we can be safe i

have to say we don't want to have too

many exemptions because if you do then

we're not going to hit the billion

dollars that we need for a year it's a

complicated issue but i am generally

supportive because it'll

a benefit for car owners who will spend

less time in traffic and obviously it'll

be a big benefit for mass transit users

thank you very much

===

my name is charles komenov

i live in tribeca and work in financial district

which places me firmly

in the congestion charging zone but i

would be an ardent supporter of

congestion pricing regardless of where i

lived

it was my bta spreadsheet an interactive

model with over one hundred thousand

equations

that the governors fix nyc panel used

from 2017 to 2019

to scope congestion pricing traffic

benefits

transit benefits health benefits and

climate benefits from this vantage point

let me remind you of two key model

outputs

one

a typical auto trip into the charging

zone between 6 am

and 8 pm on weekdays

robs other motor vehicle users of almost

90 minutes of time

collectively worth over 50 dollars by

slowing down traffic that's just inbound

double those figures for one round trip

two the net benefits of congestion

pricing subtracting out what motorists

will pay and the cost to collect the

tolls and the lost value of car trips

priced off the road those benefits are

around 3.5 billion dollars a year

divide that by 365

to see that each day congestion pricing

is delayed

costs new yorkers 10 million dollars

in lost time health efficiency and

safety

get it done please

now

no carve outs no exemptions other than

those provided in the 2019 legislation

new york needs congestion pricing

desperately

thank you

===

uh my name is eric nelson

i'm a resident of manhattan for 40 years

i spent 15 years

as a

member of community board 7 including 2

years as the chair of community board 7

on the upper west side

and i am presently the president

of the board of a very large cooperative

the coliseum

which is right on the border of the of

the proposed district

at 60th street on the west side

my neighbors and i favor congestion

pricing but

we feel

that

residents of the zone must be exempt

they must be exempt

because they had no choice have no

choice about where they live

but will as a result of this current

plan

be forced to pay

more to live in manhattan than even our

neighbors on the north side of the

street

the patent unfairness of it

is only one issue however

we

don't contribute to the problems that

congestion pricing is designed to fix

most of us who have cars

keep them garaged

and use them only to leave the city on

occasion

when we do

we do not

enter the district or drive around in it

what we do

is use our cars to leave

we also don't

um

uh want to push all the traffic now

up to 59th and 96th street causing uh

incredible traffic on the west side

highway

and increased

problems with traffic congestion

where additional cars will now be

driving to try to find parking because

they no longer want to enter the

district

===

thank you for holding this hearing and

thank you for letting me testify my name

is harvey epstein assemblymember in the

74th district i represent neighborhoods

the lower east side east village status

in town peter cooper village murray

hill

and gramercy park and i'm here just to

quickly support uh moving quickly on

congestion pricing

we know how important it is to get our

dollars in for our public transportation

i encourage us to think about what

cities like london did which was and

also from her other speakers people who

living in the congestion though getting

a deep discount uh it's really important

that we

understand that people who live there

are living in the district and whether

they do different prices for different

parts of the day like during the

congestion time or not that's obviously

an important conversation to have but i

think there's some really important

things about people who are there and

making sure that

they get supported the infrastructure

obviously we have to ensure that the

infrastructure in place is not going to

stop the flow of traffic we don't want

the infrastructure to to one stop people

from driving around into uh impacts

people's privacy rights

uh you know as we also move on

congestion pricing the issue of public

transportation and making sure there's

more accessible public transportation

especially in the congestion zone it's

critical we have buses a lot in the

lower east side this has been issues

with the busing and we want to make sure

that we improve busing for residents of

the lower east side and the 74th

assessment succession district

again congestion pricing has been really

beneficial across the world and major

cities and i think it could be a huge

benefit for new york new york city as

well i encourage you to be able to move

quickly and ensure that the residents in

the congestion zone get additional

protections that they may not have

focusing on a legislation i have around

120 percent of ami instead of just 60,000

because we make sure that we compromise

our different family sizes thank you for

allowing me to testify today

===

oh great my name is colette i have a

family here that i've been raising and

if they do uh progress with the

congested pricing you're going to start

feeling as if

this city does not want families and

people to want to move i i have to pick

up my kids from school on 28th street

and drive them every day to asphalt

green which i would go through that

congested pricing zone and for them to

charge me nine dollars a day on top of

what i'm already opening overpaid to

live in the city i think it's outrageous

and i feel as if the city is not

becoming family friendly anymore and

you're gonna start seeing families move

out because they just can't afford it so

i'm totally against this and they really

need to rethink about the family there's

no there's no good way of getting around

on the east side the second avenue

subway just sucks so for us trying to

get from 28th street to asphalt green on

90th street it's really impossible i

need to drive and i need to take

multiple children there and the only way

i can do that is in my heart so i really

think that they need to exempt the

people that live in manhattan and pay

twice as much as everyone else does

because we do live here thank you

===

mr bergman we can hear you

hello

mr bergman we can hear you please begin

your remarks okay

thank you uh my wife and i live in

murray hill

uh we're retired we're in our mid 70s

and we have the privilege

to babysit for our grandchildren

in westchester county

their house is not near a train station

so we have to drive back and forth every

day

to take care of them

sometimes to pick them up from nursery

school

and the congestion pricing would be a

terrible burden to us

we we don't know

what exceptions you're going to make

our income is over 60,000 dollars

but the only way we could get to our

grandchildren is to drive a car

and i think that you need to consider

such circumstances

and not just have a broad sweep of

everybody in the situation in this

district

===

good evening my name is ian robertson i

am a resident of midtown manhattan

our planet is dying

new reports show there will be

catastrophic rise in global warming

congestion pricing will reduce the

damage cars caused to our planet

that is a fact congestion pricing

results in reduced traffic reduced

deaths reduced illness improved air

quality and improved health

that is a true environmental impact

congestion pricing will have

we need to listen to the people of

manhattan

78 percent of us do not own cars yet we live in

one of the most polluted congested

cities in america

hundreds of pedestrians are killed each

year many of them elderly

thousands are injured traffic noise and

air pollution sickens our children and

cuts our life sharp

cars should pay for this damage

congestion pricing must be implemented

and the rates charge must fully pay for

the damaged cars cause this is our city

this is where we live this is our home

most manhattan manhattan residents fully

support congestion pricing in manhattan

and i'm sorry but the time frames you

set out are way too slow and have to be

speeded up thank you

===

i didn't realize i was muted yes my name

is arlene zalesik

and my husband and i who are both

retired

live here in manhattan very happily

and uh

what i say is we support congestive

pricing i am not going to say no but i

think for residents who live here like

so many other people say we do have a

car

because we moved to manhattan 10 years

ago from westchester county we have

friends and physicians up there our

daughter lives up there

so we do use the car but like other

people said we use it to leave the city

and come back

it is rare it does not pay to drive your

car in the city it's much cheaper to

take a taxi

than it is to drive and park in a garage

so

i'm not against it but i do think that

they should think about

some kind of

exemption

or a reduced rate for people who live

here another thing to think about is

if it goes in and it's going to cost us

every day

um

to pay

when our lease is up chances are

we will not renew the lease because it

would be cheaper

to

um take a a public transportation to get

to where we need to go outside of the

city

i think it would affect the garages they

will start emptying out from people who

live in the area

so that that is basically

what i

say they should consider giving a

discount rate

or raising the amount of the

income level that you have i don't think

there's probably not one person or very

few people who live between 60th street

and the lower limit

who only earn 60 000

if they do chances are they don't have a

car and they are not driving in the city

thank you very much

===

yeah thank you

hi my name is carl mahany and i fully

support congestion pricing i have been a

new york city resident for over 20 years

i've lived worked and sent my son to

school in the congestion zone or what is

being described

as the central business district

but calling this area a business

district is a gross mischaracterization

for us it is a living district more than

1.3 million new yorkers live in this

area and millions of others walk bike or

take transit to work and go to school

here we breathe the air here we raise

our families here we live our lives here

this is our community and our backyard

like everyone we deserve and expect

clean air quiet streets

and safe and comfortable ways to get

around

however what we have with the status quo

is hostility and aggression

noise and air pollution

and a constant physical and

psychological threat of violence thanks

to unimpeded vehicle traffic on our

streets

it has to end those who choose to drive

into and through our neighborhoods would

likely never accept these same

conditions in theirs

in fact i imagine they would try to do

something to fix it and that's what

congestion pricing does it attempts to

restore some balance to a broken and

equitable and unsustainable

transportation system

and it addresses the needs of

communities harmed by the status quo

congestion pricing is a necessary and

long overdue first step

to giving my family and millions of our

neighbors the same quality of life in

our backyard

as others expect and deserve in theirs

i fully support congestion pricing and

urge you to implement it in the fastest

possible time frame thank you very much

i'm karen pearl president and ceo of

god's love we deliver

god's love we deliver is new york city's

leading not-for-profit provider of

medically tailored meals and nutrition

counseling for people living with

life-threatening illnesses we are

dedicated to cooking and delivering the

specific nutritious meals a client's

severe illness and treatment so urgently

require

we support families by providing meals

for the children and caregivers of our

clients

all of our services are provided free of

charge to clients and we are proud that

in our 36 year history we have never had

a waiting list

our kitchen and home base is in soho

every weekday without fail our

refrigerated meal delivery vans travel

in and out of the central central

business district to deliver life-saving

meals to people living with severe

illness in all five boroughs

in westchester long island and parts of

new jersey

illness knows no boundaries we serve

every demographic with most of our

clients identifying as populations of

color

and most living at or below the federal

poverty level

as an essential service provider

god's love has not missed one delivery

and at the height of the pandemic we saw

a 30 percent increase in demand

i come before you to request an

exemption from the central business

district tolling program

for our refrigerator delivery vans

modeling rates and previous congested

pricing proposals this program has the

potential to cost god's love five

hundred thousand dollars a year

and impact the delivery outside of the

business district of over two point four

million meals to nine thousand

individuals annually

this sum for tolls will dramatically

hurt our program and our ability to

provide them our life-sustaining meals

and threaten our commitment to never

having a waiting list

we support the environmental and equity

goals of the tolling program but these

yes cannot be made at the expense of the

most vulnerable and isolated in our

communities thank you

===

good evening and thank you for letting

the east midtown coalition speak this

evening we represent 38 buildings on the

east side of manhattan and our ask is as

follows we want an exemption for

residents below 61st street or at least

offer a 50 discount to residents that

are living below we understand this

revenue will generate about 60 million

dollars in revenue if that is in place

however it's just a small drop in the

bucket of the 15 million billion dollars

that the mta is trying to raise we were

advised to make suggestions to offer a

recapture for this revenue if this

exemption or discount was granted so we

are proposing to either mandate bicycle

licenses and charge for the application

of the license and flex subway pricing

so we would have dynamic congestion

pricing on the subway or charge

different rates for the different zones

on the subway another suggestion is to

add three to five dollars in a surcharge

to all parking tickets in manhattan or

reinstate the commuter tax since this is

really how congestion is happening or

toll one of the free brooklyn bridges we

also have concerns about tolling

residents below 61st street one of these

is the valuation of properties it may

drop below 61st street and increase

right above it the small businesses will

be hurt cost of living will rise as all

of those costs will be put on the

residence and like london the funds will

never be enough and the zone will need

to be expanded to the 70s 80s and beyond

because they will always need more

funding and like london whose program

has been operating for 17 years this

will never end thank you i am one of the

east midtown coalition congestion

pricing committee members the others are

joan brothers myself lisa chase dr glenn

cosman jerry rosencrantz and ralph

sutton thank you all for for allowing us

to have a platform tonight

===

hi my name is rachel and i am a resident

of the manhattan central business

district as described by the congestion

pricing project

um i am a car owner but i'm also an avid

cyclist and a bicycle advocate

as a resident we are constantly

bombarded with endless amounts of

traffic our health and well-being is

impacted by excessive amounts of cars on

the streets particularly vehicles that

are here um and parking illegally i

might add um with an extensive amount of

placard abuse happening in this

neighborhood and

unlike other residents of the east side

i don't want there to be a carve out i

own a vehicle but i believe that we

should all be responsible for the

choices that we make

and that the

extensive carve-outs that are being

requested are again going to reduce the

effectiveness of congestion pricing

reduce the amount of income streams and

also

fail to

adequately reduce the impact of

cars on our streets thank you

===

all right can you hear me

hi uh my name is andrew marcus i'm a

lifelong new york city resident and i

also am an urban planner and proud

public servant for the city of new york

uh i would like to make a few remarks

the first i echo the other comment that

i think language matters and while this

program is referring to the area south

of 60th street as the central business

district

in fact i don't think this is a fair

term it is actually a collection of over

a dozen neighborhoods where people live

it is not just a district with office

buildings and businesses but it's a

place where people call home where

people live and raise their families and

i think that our language masks that

reality

um the second thing i want to say is

that for the environmental assessment i

really urge you to look at the human

environment and the socioeconomic

impacts and cultural assets and how they

will be impacted specifically i'm proud

to uh be a board member of kahila

kadoshayanina which is a historic

landmark synagogue museum on the lower

east side

we sustain ourselves through donations

we're a small community center and

cultural organization

but we depend on our volunteers to drive

and bring in supplies and kosher food

from both brooklyn and queens and

elsewhere where we can get supplies and

this congestion fee would be a real

burden on our organization our community

and we feel that non-profits

like ours should be given an exemption

in recognition of what we contribute to

the community so i urge the

environmental assessment to consider the

cultural asset implications of this as

was mentioned for god's love we deliver

um i also urge you to consider in the

scenarios an exemption

residents uh because as was said

there's so many expenses that we deal

with right now and this will undoubtedly

increase the cost of living for

everything that we purchase and do in

the area south of 60th street and there

needs to be a recognition that current

law of 60,000 and below is grossly

inadequate i'm a public servant i'm not

wealthy i don't live in luxury housing

and it's barely able to it's barely

possible to live here and sustain

ourselves and this would just add to the

cost of living so i urge you to consider

all these thank you

===

hi my name is jason gurz i'm a resident

of the lower east side of manhattan and

i'm the volunteer chair of the manhattan

activist committee with transportation

alternatives

uh i

strongly support congestion pricing and

urge the city and state to implement it

as soon as possible

i bike my daughter to school

about a mile every day through bike

lanes and open streets and yet

what should be an enjoyable ride is

often a hellish and stressful experience

as we're battling multiple

cars and trucks that park in our bike

lanes jockey for position to get on and

off the williamsburg bridge

honk blow smoke

uh and create just a traffic disaster

and a space that is not adequately

planned to uh house this much car

traffic

uh even on the street that her school is

on which the dot has said should be car

free our principal principals out every

morning begging people not to drive

their kids to school and instead to find

other alternatives because she's afraid

that one parent is going to drive over

another

child that attends our school

inadvertently while making a drop off or

pick up i strongly support implementing

this without exceptions if you live in

manhattan below 60 street and you own a

car you are one of the privileged

folks who are wealthier than average and

one of a very small percentage of people

who bothered to keep a car you do not

you still contribute to the congestion

you contribute to the air pollution you

contribute to the noise

and you contribute to the safety risk of

for those who walk

take the bus and bicycle so uh there

should be no exceptions this should be a

fair and equal program that could be

easily and well implemented as soon as

possible for everybody's benefit thank

you

===

hey uh brock friedman can you hear me

okay

yeah i'm not sure why uh the um

you can't see me

we can hear you and see you can be in

your remote okay sorry um

so i mean i usually support congestion

pricing

if you like breathing clean air this is

a huge win our air quality is horrendous

in manhattan

you're doing an environmental assessment

that's wonderful

new york city is extremely vulnerable to

climate change remember hurricane sandy

we were decimated remember just these

recent floods where it rained a lot we

were decimated it's only going to get

worse we need action now we have to

implement now we can't wait

um if you have children in new york city

and you want your children to have a

future if you're young and want

uh to have a future we need to have

action and implement we can't just wait

if you want an economic recovery for

manhattan it's not going to happen with

massive congestion

congestion everywhere nobody wants the

congestion everywhere businesses don't

want to come it reduces quality of life

these businesses can go out elsewhere

they go to london for a better quality

of life so i urge you to come new york

city is a global city compete on a

global scale

uh it's safer for people who walk it's

safer for people who ride a bicycle it's

wonderful for people who take public

transit we need to fund our public

transit

i urge you to limit exemptions i urge

the politicians to stop

trying to carve out uh exemptions

manhattan is overwhelmingly car free uh

we don't want a politician that's just

looking to carve out non-uh exemptions

for everybody uh if i drive a car in

manhattan i want to pay for it

thank you for the time

===

hello

hello

hi we can hear you and see you please be

in your room

great hi my name is andrea peterson and

i've lived on lafayette street below

houston for over 40 years and raise a

family here traffic is back with a

vengeance and so is illegal parking on

my neighborhood streets sidewalks and

bike lanes lafayette prince and canal

streets become parking lots every day

honking is outrageous these cars affect

our safety and their emissions

contribute to high rates of asthma doing

harm to the environment and our quality

of life

i urge you now to implement congestion

pricing

immediately the sooner the better two

years is ridiculous it's time for

the city to put new york city first the

people that live here thank you

===

all righty

hopefully you can see and hear me um

my name's samuel lavinia i live in

manhattan near union square park and i

think i bring an interesting perspective

because i lived in two other cities in

the world that do have congestion

pricing singapore and london

i'm a frequent rider for the 456 trains

and the m14 bus on the recently added

well somewhat recently added beautiful

bus way we have here

but that being said the trains are so

unreliable and manhattan is such a

beautiful car light walkable

island that i often walk or city bike

around

unfortunately that's not possible for

people who live in other

neighborhoods who rely on the transit

more

transit is like failing riders all the

time including myself you know we're

waiting on the platforms forever uh

union square park is the the platform is

like incredibly hot i've seen people

have heat stroke there uh this money

can't come soon enough to make

improvements to make it safer faster

more reliable

um

the the money that would be raised would

help

significantly with all these things as i

said i often walk or bike and congestion

pricing wouldn't just help us get our

trains on time or our buses it would

also clear the air we breathe make hot

days more bearable with less idling

vehicles make our city quieter uh and

very importantly let emergency medical

service vehicles move around more freely

we just walk around manhattan you can

see these

the sirens going off they're stuck

people are dying

in these vehicles or like they're the

buildings are on fire and the people

can't get there fast enough

the environment is also key

the vast majority of cbd residents don't

have access to cars and why should we

subsidize the lifestyles of car owners

if you want to own a car in the central

business district as it's described

you should have to pay for it i have

lots of sympathy for owners who need

their cars such as people with

disabilities but i have very little

sympathy for people who just need their

cars once in a while to drive out of the

weekend when i lived in london

what we would do on the congestion

pricing times is we would take the bus

and i would encourage everyone to take

the bus instead of driving their car

thank you

===

hi i take it you can hear me

thank you for taking my testimony today

uh well people outside manhattan think

of this as the central business district

we live here we shop we raise kids we

walk we run we ride bikes we take public

transportation

eighty percent of manhattanites do not

own cars so why are we assaulted every

day by people who insist on driving in

one at a time and parking in our

neighborhoods how would they feel if

three million of us showed up daily on

their streets and the worst part is it's

not necessary the central business

district is a transportation hub

as someone who manages an open street in

manhattan i've seen firsthand

what streets and fewer cars mean to

residents an open street is still open

to deliveries businesses and local

residents but closely through traffic

drivers whose destination is elsewhere

the moment we restricted traffic here

the difference was palpable people began

to bring children from other blocks to

learn how to ride their bikes people

with disabilities rode in the street

people began to walk through with their

dogs wheel grocery carts talked to each

other skateboards scooters the block

came alive open streets are safe and

extremely popular throughout the five

boroughs we're lucky but we're right

near a major arterial road where honking

and road rage are endemic people get hit

there all the time and are killed

new york businesses aren't even back

commercial buildings sit largely empty

and our roads are gridlocked pollution

is off the charts and drivers aren't

happy either traffic makes them crazy

and they misbehave eighteen hundred

people killed from traffic violence

since de blasio took office and this

year is the worst of all congestion

pricing will reduce the number of cars

on our streets which will make us all

safer we'll also fund clean efficient

public transportation so everyone wins

in that space it goes for driving and

parking we could use it for wider

sidewalks bike racks seating even

gardens and many playgrounds and that

time spent driving could be used on

clean public transportation making the

lives of commuters so much better

honestly with climate change breathing

down our necks i do not understand why

this is taking so long when the answer

is so obvious we need congestion pricing

yesterday do it now and no carve outs

except for people with disabilities

===

okay

all right first of all congestion

pricing is

seriously needed and long awaited

however there are many other

situations that should be considered

first of all there's life outside of new

york city there's food family and life

there's also the consideration of those

who live in new york city and are paying

a huge amount of money in one way or

another there should be exemptions for

those that are within this circle of

uh

taxing and

don't ransom create a ransom around

our opportunities to leave the city and

enjoy what's outside the city besides

what's in the city

uh

there's just so much more i could say

give us some sort of a free ride come in

early

or we'll leave late and give us a

discount

don't turn us into a cash register we've

already become that many many times over

thank you

===

um i just wanted to say

that living in manhattan is expensive

enough i feel that we're being

discriminated against

being charged every time we take our car

out for an errand or to go visit family

i don't think the people in manhattan

are really

the culprits in this situation it's the

people who are coming in from outside

which obviously you want to charge so i

feel that we should be exempt

from the congestion pricing we pay

enough taxes in new york city we pay

parking taxes in new york city we pay

taxes everywhere you turn around so i

think that would only be fair that we

should be exempt

from this congestion pricing tax

thank you

===

hi i'm joe bergman i live in i've lived

in hell's kitchen for almost 50 years

i'm opposed to congestion pricing for

these reasons

congestion has been made worse due to

bus lanes that are blocked by parked

cars delivery trucks and construction

bicycle lanes which are barely used

especially in colder months have become

a danger to pedestrians and still

bicycles are ridden on the sidewalks

also electric scooters and bikes rarely

use the bike lanes

trucks double parked in the few lanes

that are left are pinching traffic

traffic control officers are rarely

around when traffic is heavy

congestion pricing negatively affects

people with lower income the price will

not matter to the rich it is unfair to

penalize people with cars who live in

the area we should be exempt

it will put taxi and uber lyft etc

prices out of reach for many people

but the extra costs will be passed on to

consumers anyway

and transit fares will still rise

where are the plans for more subways to

transit for west side or brooklyn

just vague promises of improvement

transit fares were 35 cents when i first

moved to new york city in 1972.

now it's approaching three dollars

other than a few shiny improvements it's

pretty much the same system so what

makes you think more money run from

drivers into a so-called lock box will

make a difference

except of course to mta officials

salaries

why not charge everyone with a vehicle

in the five boroughs why redline midtown

those outside the business district are

part of the environment as well

personally i've had a car for 25 years i

park it in my building and it's allowed

me to take my daughters to school school

buses were constantly late i never

showed up and there were people 

okay uh my wife and i are retired and we

we have a hard time getting around

please listen to the people who will be

negatively affected rather than the

consultants who are hired to reinforce

what you already have decided thank you

for your time

===

thank you

my name is

my name is james bichmann i live on 15th

street in

in the flat iron district i'm a member

of community board 5 but i'm here only

representing my own thoughts and not

those of

community board 5. i understand the

exemption for people

learning earning less than 60 thousand

dollars

and that seems to be a good idea but i

agree with the other speakers who said

everyone should pay everyone who lives

in manhattan who has an automobile

should pay

and i'm wondering if

ideas like are done in london

might be considered here

where if you live outside the zone and

you come into the zone you pay a very

high fee

if you live in the zone and you have a

vehicle registered in the zone you pay a

yearly

highly discounted flat fee

i i would support congestion pricing

and the economics of it uh by some

creative means as that

um and i think that's where things ought

to go i agree with assemblyman assembly

member glick pardon me

and

also with the gentleman who said that

these automobiles are not really driven

in manhattan

for most of the people who live here in

22 years i have made three trips in

manhattan i'll never do it again

because the traffic is so unbearable my

car is used simply as many have said uh

for leaving the city and that goes for

people who live in this district as well

as people who live

outs above 60th street and we should all

pay and i'm willing i'm willing to do

that

on a reasonable basis and an equitable

basis

that's my opinion thank you

===

yes okay um miriam fisher

uh long time activist for traffic uh

reduction uh

since i was personally

hit by yellow cab and has spent a

lifetime with back

difficulties and also disability

advocates i support obviously congestion

pricing but i want to talk about

exemptions for people with disabilities

uh to expand and maintain the 2019

law of qualifying vehicles for

transportation for people with

disabilities

people with disabilities have limited

choices in transit the subway has only

about 25

percent accessibility with elevators and many

at a given time about 25 daily are not

working

all

supporting the model in london as

something to

look at

with uh people who are both uh

car owners and people who are not car

owners by driven by owners who need the

transportation and don't have a lot of

choices

uh all modes of transportation needed

whether accessorized

vehicles as in london transportation for

all life needs equal status with persons

who are not disabled people with

disabilities don't only go to medical

appointments but ha have lives and full

lives are trying to

uh and all uh

it's a regressive tax on people uh with

disabilities who are largely a

low-income population many unemployed or

underemployed many on disability

benefits fewer 

new york times uh march 2021

fewer than one half working age are

disabled

in labor for let me finish my sentence

please

===

hi everyone my name is harris um thank

you very much for the opportunity to

speak today um

a lot of my points were reiterated um by

the many people before me who spoke very

eloquently um

namely andrew collette eric

deborah howie

um

those are obviously the names of the

people um individually and uh really to

summarize a lot of the things that we've

talked about today um one of the things

we talked about is you know wanting

better transit systems in new york city

um

reducing the congestion a cleaner

environment um but there are other costs

to think about as well um that where we

we've that has been touched on today and

one of them of course is car ownership

is uh not really optional for certain

people it's a necessity because getting

out of the city is is really troublesome

as a resident um especially to certain

parts right like the areas that are not

connected by

um the longer commuter trains or the mta

um and those kind of connections or

connectivity takes time to build right

that's not going to happen overnight

it's not going to happen in a year or

two it's going to take longer um that's

a reality um another really major

concern that i also want to call out

apart from the fact of people who own

cars is actually the expense that it's

going to now um put on the entire system

so let's take residents out of um

residents owning cars out of it let's

take the fact that if you

live in new york city

um now the delivery truck that comes in

to transport goods to groceries near you

needs to pay a higher fees

they're going to try to transfer all

that cost over

onto the consumer so we're going to now

see higher costs for uh products that we

regularly need to you know services and

products that we purchase in manhattan

and this is this is really challenging

and is probably going to reshape new

york city um which probably will be

needed given the the environmental

concerns we have um but it's already an

extremely expensive city and this is

something that we should all consider

that it's going to it's not just going

to hit car owners it's going to affect

everybody so please consider that thank

you very much

===

hi my name is andrea haynes i'm a

resident of the district um living on

37th street um i've been here for over a

decade

um and the reason why i have concern and

i'm against the congestion pricing it's

because i just have a feeling and i know

that it won't be done correctly i mean i

have been on this uh call for now quite

some time um and i already know that my

peers um people of color people who live

out in the boroughs will be strongly

affected by this um it's really sad that

you know i moved here to the district

from co-op city

over a decade ago and i almost have

survival remorse not survivor remorse um

because i have access to different

resources that are available in the city

that people who live where my family

lives and we often joke about it being

behind god's back in co-op city or east

new york their commute is almost two

hours if not longer sometimes depending

on where they're coming from and it's

really fair and unfortunate that at a

time like this where we're already

seeing disparities i mean living down

here for example today when i went to

work i had an issue with child care and

needed a family member to come from

behind god's back to pick up my daughter

and that was a concern like you know for

my family that comes down to you know

visit and help you know they they've

always questioned how do i even afford

the resources here and and i'm a civil

servant right i'm here to do the good

work of the city like everyone here uh

but i don't make six figures and neither

does my partner and this is becoming

quite impossible and it is going to

reshape what the city looks like based

on resources available to people who

look and work like me like i'm waiting

for everyone else who looks like me on

this meeting but guess what they're not

home yet because there's a thunderstorm

and it might have taken them two hours

to get home so i just asked that we

please not reshape new york city let's

address some of the disparities that

have pushed people so far out that they

actually need a car to get around new

york city and then that will provide the

opportunity to address uh issues and

problems like this at a later time

because no i don't want to continue

cleaning my walls because

just like what my lungs look like

but i want to be fair to everyone who

can't afford it thank you

===

hi

my name is charles todd i'm a resident

of hell's kitchen near 9th avenue

like 80 percent of manhattan residents i

do not own a car despite non-car owners

being in the extreme majority we find

ourselves surrounded by congestion ninth

avenue is a literal parking lot every

afternoon it's a nightmare crossing the

street with my children weaving in and

out of honking cars blocking the box

with my stroller when i walk my child to

school in the morning we can barely hear

each other speak as enormous trucks

rumble by us we need cleaner air and

safer streets we need to improve our

public transportation infrastructure we

need more dedicated bus lanes and more

bike lanes we need our we need to fight

climate change as our city continues to

flood as it's doing currently where's

the flash flood happening right now

uh congestion pricing will help with all

of these issues we were promised it

would start in january of this year we

understand the trump administration and

covid delayed but it is time to move

quickly please please hurry this up we

do not need to study the obvious anymore

congestion is making our city

demonstrably worse please get this done

as soon as possible

the conversation about exemptions is a

distraction

if you choose to own a car

and to drive your vacation property

twice a month you can pay a toll if you

don't want to take public transit to get

to the airport you can pay the toll if

you choose to enroll your children at a

private school in another neighborhood

rather than your zone school you can pay

the toll to drive from there we should

all pay as residents here we are the

traffic if you are in a car you are the

traffic we do not need any exemptions

beyond that for the existing exemptions

for people with disabilities and people

making below 60k

hearing earlier tonight that you're

still going to be in the planning and

public comment phase in 2023 made me

want to cry we've been waiting a long

time for this please hurry thank you

===

can you hear me

yes we can hear you

hello

hello we can hear you

wonderful um my name is cody lindquist

and i am a strong supporter of

congestion pricing

i am raising two young sons in hell's

kitchen

and it's very important to me that they

have clean air to breathe this has been

something that has been in the works for

a long time it keeps getting delayed but

my children are young their lungs are

young they need to be able to breathe

clean air

we walk with our children it is a

parking lot on ninth avenue their school

is completely covered in cars it's not

sustainable it's completely dangerous

i highly recommend this the people that

are clinging to their cars because it's

difficult to get around the city well

the whole point is that we'll have more

money to make public transit better to

make the bus lanes better to make the

bike lanes better i bike with my

children whenever i go around the city

and it's easy

it will get more

easy to move around and to have these

public

transportation things happen if we have

more money so i highly suggest that we

do this as soon as possible

yesterday would have been better so

thank you so much

===

okay so yeah my name's tyler butler i am

27 years old in greenwich village

and yeah i just have to say that i'm

pretty happy to see all the people on

here supporting the congestion pricing i

think usually for

public meetings like this everybody just

gets on to complain about it so

yeah i think this is a really good sign

of support that the

general community really supports this

if so many people are getting on just to

support it

so yeah i'm gonna try to knock over the

things that people have already

mentioned um i know a lot of people

mentioned

london's successful congestion pricing

program and yeah just to add on to that

london faced

huge backlash when they first proposed

the program as well but a lot of the

people that initially were against it

after it was implemented

changed their minds and

the data has shown that a lot of

people's concerns for instance increased

traffic in other areas not part of the

tolling program

that didn't pan out and it was actually

a lot better than they expected

um and just yeah some other concerns

that i have um

let's see a lot of people have been

mentioning manhattan exemptions and

i don't own a car but

i sometimes take ubers to the airport

and i realize that would be more

expensive but i am totally willing to

give that up and take the train

so i think that's fair and uh one other

big everybody knows that

um with our current tolling system

there's been a huge problem with uh

people with fake license plates

and other vehicles like dirt bikes and

things that are some of the worst

defenders when it comes to noise

so i'd hope that people uh implementing

the congestion pricing

think about how to enforce that more

and that's it for me thank you

===

hi can you hear me

yes we can hear you

great thanks my name is miles mcmanus

i've been a cbd resident and an mta

customer for over 30 years

i'm in favor and happy to pay the tolls

when we do rent a car and my main

message is that your timeline is just

way too long

we've seen this before we see it all the

time new yorkers are used to our mayors

and governors and public agencies taking

credit for big ideas then kicking the

can down the road and blaming someone

else when nothing gets done

but you know you have a big problem when

your idea is so overdue that the

wikipedia page about it is too long to

read

we all know there will never be a

solution that makes everybody happy

but it won't be too hard to finalize a

plan that delivers all the benefits

while protecting environmental justice

and other vulnerable communities that's

the right approach and you've made a

great start already we just need you to

finish the job

new york state's clcpa law and new york

city's climate emergency declaration are

two examples of new york talking big and

doing nothing to protect our climate and

the environment

here's your chance to change that trend

we need congestion pricing now to cut

down the traffic reduce emissions lower

air and noise pollution slow down the

climate crisis boost public public

transit and make our city better

so please

pick up the pace make sure it's green

make sure it's equitable and get it done

now

not two years from now thank you

===

my name is lawrence shire in the past i

worked for the port authority as an

attorney in the real estate and

environmental law division for more than

a decade

i've been a member of

manhattan community board six serving on

the transportation committee cd6 runs

along the east side from east 14th

street to east 59th street however my

testimony today is solely in my personal

capacity i live and i work in the

district as part of taking a hard look

at the environmental impact of

congestion pricing in manhattan below

60th street on those most impacted i'm

here to provide enthusiastic support for

transit enhancing pollution reducing

traffic improvements if the final plan's

pricing is dynamic and flexible like

airline ticket fees then it has the

greatest opportunity to appropriately

control levels of traffic in real time

most of the time i use public

transportation and i expect to see huge

improvements in bus service as a result

of this plan i also garage a car in the

area and i believe everyone who drives a

motor vehicle on these congested streets

becomes traffic and should be charged

something scaled according to number of

axles and weight for being traffic

granting exemptions to opportunistic

privileged classes of drivers will in my

opinion encourage excessive driving and

that will undermine this entire effort

in closing i commend to you charles

komenov's detailed economic based

analysis of the impact of congestion

pricing thank you so much for listening

===

yes my name is christine bertay i am the

co-chair of transportation committee on

manhattan community board 4

located on the west side of midtown

the central business district is home to

a million residents

and the traffic is killing us

168 fatalities 39 000 injuries in 10

years

health department estimates

show that each year pm25 pollution new

york city causes more than three

thousand day

two thousand hospital emission

and approximately six thousand emergency

department visits

congestion pricing is a proven method to

address those issues

based on london experience this the city

should experience 71 fewer fatalities

and 17 000 fewer injuries

16 percent reproduction co2

and if this is not enough reason

any driver in the city will save an

average of five days or years in delays

taxi drivers will be able to make more

trips and customers will get better

service in our district

we have

overwhelmed every day by thousands of

new jersey drivers who idol for up to

five hours on miles of local streets

as a result our district has the third

worst air quality in the city it is

crucial that no exemption be given to

new jersey driver so that our resident

can breathe again

please pass congestion pricing now

thank you

===

uh yeah hello i think you can hear me

um

hi my name is daniel henge

and i'm a resident and employee in

midtown and chelsea

i fully support the implementation of

congestion pricing in the central

business district for several reasons

for one uh this city does not yet have a

solution for ensuring that the costs of

the public from vehicles are adequately

accounted for each car ride incurs a

debt to the environment through

emissions and incurs a debt to public

health and safety through street level

pollution noise and collisions

regardless of whether these rides have

suitable suitable public alternatives or

not the personal cost is

cheaper than it truly is when you

account for the cost to the public

and this is still true regardless of the

purpose of the ride be it essential

deliveries or rides from residents

within the district

just as gasoline is a cost for driving

um or electric

for electric vehicle the mindset in a

city this dense must shift to include

repaying the debt

incurred to the public as another

responsibility that comes with driving

congestion pricing will add a mechanism

for sharing the cost to the public that

has always been there

among those who incur it

secondly this implementation will help

reduce congestion in the city as a daily

cyclist and pedestrian in the cbd i have

a huge grievance with block boxes

block boxes pose an immense danger for

cyclists and pedestrians who must weave

outside of bike lanes into the car lane

or share a one to two foot gap of space

between cars with the pedestrians to

make it through the intersection when

they have the right-of-way

enforcement against blocking the box is

non-existent at worst

and inconsistent at best and is much

less efficient than using a toll-based

approach to reduce traffic

i urge you to rapidly enact as a policy

and to limit the exemptions made to the

toll i sympathize with vehicle trips for

non-profit purposes and to accommodate

disabilities

but if exemptions are considered please

weigh the benefits to the public from

these trips against the as of yet unpaid

debt to the public from driving thank

you

===

sorry i'm just turning on the video

my name is jane selden and i'm speaking

today

both as a long-term resident of lower

manhattan and on behalf of 350 nyc a

grassroots environmental group

350 nyc fully supports the cbd tolling

program because it will reduce

greenhouse gas emissions and improve the

health of our communities

however we would like to see the mta

speed up its implementation of the plan

the death and devastation caused by

hurricane ida has been another jolting

reminder that the climate crisis has

arrived

climate scientists tell us we need to

move fast to drastically reduce

greenhouse gas emissions to avert more

frequent and catastrophic weather events

in the near future the transportation

sector constitutes 30 percent of

greenhouse gas emissions in the city

with cars and trucks being the largest

contributors and now we have the worst

traffic congestion in the country

driving up vehicle emissions even

further because engines idling in

traffic produce twice the tailpipe

exhaust as cars in motion

gas-fueled vehicle exhaust also contains

a host of toxins like nitrogen oxide and

small particulate matter linked to

higher rates of heart and lung disease

and other health conditions and higher

mortality rates from covid19 these

adverse health effects

disproportionately impact low income

communities and communities of color we

know that congestion pricing has direct

health benefits because we've seen

evidence of this in other cities in

stockholm for example there was a 15

drop in particulate matter

and a dramatic reduction in childhood

asthma the cbd tolling program is an

important step towards addressing these

intertwined environmental and public

health crises the seven billion dollars

a year in revenue generated

remarks

will be used to modernize expand and

speed up public transit thereby

incentivizing more sustainable

alternatives to car travel but we can't

afford to wait at least two thank you

===

my name is aaron tamara actually

couldn't be available tonight i live on

43rd street in manhattan plaza which was

originally designed

as performance artist subsidized housing

we still have a lot of uh performance

artists here and we also have other

subsidized subsidized housing programs

but today i speak on behalf of myself

um i'm fully 100 on board with this

pricing scheme for

environmental purposes as well as

funding the mta we can see the weather

out our windows right now and we all

remember the videos of the flooded

subway systems

from before so i think that this is a

great idea but like many

other people i advocate in support of

some exemptions and subsidies for people

who live here i think assemblyman

assembly person glick said really well

that just living here is going to become

more expensive whether you have a car or

not

and

when i consider

a toll or a tax for something that

people can't really change it almost

starts to sound like a discrimination

and for people who say well if you don't

have to live here you can just live

someplace else

um

people can't really just up and move but

that's not really an option for everyone

and another point i want to make is um

a neighbor ian robinson made a really

strong appeal for the environmental case

for congestion pricing and i totally

support it part of that appeal was that

um he cited 78 of manhattan residents

actually don't have cars

so when we're talking about living in

this neighborhood we are not the ones

who are driving

we start to consider the fact that um

we are contributing more to the funding

of the mta as opposed to the

environmental impact as ourselves as

residents so i think that's unfair but i

support the program thank you for your

time

===

hi everyone

my name is aditya mukherjee and i'm a

third generation new yorker and a

resident of the so-called central

business district

even though i already qualify for an

exemption under the proposed rules i

urge the mta to implement congestion

pricing fairly and that means with no

exemptions for any group whatsoever

i encourage you to google placarded

abuse and see how rampant placard

corruption already is amongst municipal

workers government officials and law

enforcement they regularly abuse parking

plaza placards to park personal vehicles

illegally often creating safety hazards

taxpayers should not be subsidizing

people endangering others for personal

gain whether that means illegally

blocking a fire hydrant or abusing an

exemption and contributing to climate

change in the process

the majority of new yorkers and over 85

percent of cbd residents don't own a car

car ownership is already skewed towards

the wealthiest residents the best way to

support low-income new yorkers is to

invest in public transit

any exemptions undermine the core

principle that our environmentally

friendly public transportation system

should be the first choice of

transportation for all new yorkers

harvard researchers have found that air

pollution from new york city traffic

causes 1400 premature deaths and

billions in health care costs every

single year those of us who live in the

central business district will benefit

the most from congestion pricing and

will benefit the most if it is applied

to everyone we will benefit from

increased service to our excellent

public transit system and from lower

traffic congestion we will gain the

health benefits of reduced air pollution

and better air quality near our homes

for us and for our kids and of course we

will benefit by slowing the tides of

irreversible climate change

we need congestion pricing and we need

it now

zero exception exceptions or exemptions

thank you

===

good evening everyone

my name is rosa and i live in gramercy

park and have been manhattan resident

for more than 20 years

i fully support the improvement of the

public transit system however the

funding of such improvements through the

proposed congestion pricing places an

unfair burden on the residents below

60th street

the benefits of an improved public

transit system would benefit everyone

however under the current proposal the

residents below 60th street will be

unfairly and disproportionately impacted

by this surcharge we will be subjecting

to the surcharge just to get back to our

home within the congestion zone or

because we rely on the car to get to and

from work outside the city or to get our

elderly parents to see their doctors

deliveries services and airport

transportation to us would also go up to

reflect the additional charges

it's already very hard to raise a family

in city and this surcharge will unfairly

penalize the residents below 60th street

simply because the location of their

residence

people living outside the congestion

zone would have the option of avoiding

or going around it people living within

the zone don't

therefore residents within this

congestion zone should be exempted

at a minimum all cars that have

registered residents below 60th street

should be exempted from the congestion

pricing

congestion has made so much worse by

creation of bus lanes that are rarely

used as well as the uber cars not by

residents congestion pricing should be

assessed on the whopper cars and the

light that are responsible for the

unregulated number of cars endlessly

circling our blocks resulting ever

worsening congestion and air pollution

for everyone thank you

===

oh okay thank you so much for allowing

me to speak uh my name is michael

gunsberg i'm a resident

of the

midtown manhattan district and i

actually live on east 58th street and i

do have a vehicle

and i feel that every time i would take

my vehicle out whether i go to the bronx

brooklyn or queens i'd be subject to

paying congestion pricing

especially since i don't drive

south of 58th street but go to the outer

boroughs

so i would

ask that the board consider

an exemption from manhattan residents

because i think it's onerous it's unfair

and i think it's an additional tax on

being a resident within the district

one other thing that i think is very

important that the board needs to

consider is the fact that the pandemic

has had a devastating effect on the

midtown area there are currently so many

buildings that are empty so many stores

that are empty and now is not the time

to uh to implement congestion pricing

because the city really needs to recover

economically and i'm surprised nobody's

mentioned it but the city has really

been devastated in this area i mean i

walk down the street on third avenue and

there are so many stores that are empty

so to implement congestion pricing at

this time it's just not economically

practical

so i feel that while it may be a good

thing to seriously to consider in the

future today is not the time to

implement it based on what's going on in

the city thank you so much

===

right

um

hi i live in hell's kitchen

and i am

right by the lincoln tunnel

and i do support uh congestion pricing

because we've lost traffic lanes because

of the bike lanes which i love as a

biker

but also outdoor dining

so

ninth avenue the the horn honking goes

from 2 30 in the afternoon until 9 30 at

night

um i'm an actor it's very very dif it's

going on right now

uh it's very difficult to

record anything in my apartment for

voice over or auditions or anything like

that

um

so and also we've had all of these um

souped-up cars drag racing and

motorcycle rallies so i'm for the

program however

i am low income as are many many of my

neighbors

um i do have a 25 year old car which i

need for work

i garage it i already pay for a garage

um

i don't have a choice of

when i'm driving in and out of this zone

i live in the zone

um and i do feel that the residents

would be unfairly taxed

and

uh

what else

well

that's that's basically it um we need to

please keep the exemption for the 60k

and below

because

my neighbors musicians we travel with a

lot of stuff i would lose 30 percent of

my income if i can't afford to have my

car here

thank you for the opportunity to be

heard

===

thank you i'm harry malakoff i live in

chelsea and i very much favor congestion

parking

pricing

the main goal of congestion pricing is

to reduce traffic and improve air

quality

if the city is truly interested in doing

this we should implement resident only

parking at all alternate side spaces

right now many suburbanites drive in to

residential areas such as the upper west

side chelsea the lower east side and

other areas in the congestion zone and

they park at alternate side spaces free

of charge

while polluting the air resident only

parking which is in force in boston

washington dc

chicago san francisco many other cities

would stop this practice and right there

would reduce congestion

resident only parking would also bring

in

over 100 million dollars a year to the

city and state by forcing the thousands

of resident new yorkers who illegally

register their vehicles elsewhere

this dollar number incidentally was

generated by cranes new york business

so

all i'm saying is in addition

to the congestion parking we need

resident only parking

uh

in most of manhattan if not the entire

city thank you

===

yes okay thank you uh my name is uh

isaac ross i'm a resident and a car

owner in manhattan for 32 years

in uh third in theory the environmental

upsides make some sense and some other

cities have done this around the world

but when new york city tries to model

itself on other cities it's a problem

because new york city is unique those

who compare us to london and stockholm

conveniently don't mention that there is

no social safety net and excellent

public transportation like in stockholm

or london

uh you know we have to pay for

everything here including healthcare and

we have we are very cost burdened a

one-size-fits-all approach doesn't

consider the diversity unique to unity

to the new york city workspace landscape

as to causes i've not heard any

acknowledgement that increased

congestion is caused by the boom in

under-regulated ride sharing

uh companies like uber lyft boom and

deliveries the boom in construction and

over development over decades the

permanent bike lanes that block

thoroughfares and parking and disrupt

traffic flow

what is the plan to address these causes

and what studies are out there to target

mitigation measures to the causes

proportionally

uh to those who like to pass judgment on

car owners we're not all just driving to

the hamptons guys maybe you may be able

to bike your kids to school but what

about reverse commuters and independent

interpreters or solopreneurs who now

represent a growing share of the new gig

economy who rely on a private vehicle to

move equipment and to access areas not

covered by public transportation which

is the overwhelming majority will there

be a consideration of this there's no

considerations for the residents of the

affected area who already pay a city tax

pay the highest rates on parking

insurance and all other expenses who pay

the highest rent for parking and are

taxed on that who pay the highest tolls

already and have greatly diminished

access to their residence due to the

open restaurants and citi bike programs

how will this consider residents who

already cost burden for transportation

who have the same rights as the anti-car

activists

this comes after decades where the trend

is to victimize vehicles with no

evidence that anti-car policies are

effective for decades the knee-jerk

reaction is to go to the to use to go

after the private car you can't create

an economy based on the private car for

60 years and then all of a sudden

reverse course

thank you without addressing the root

cause of the issue which is the

availability and geographical

distribution of work and the rise of the

economy exemptions for people such as

the above will not have will have

hi my name is henry

falcone i'm a lifelong resident

of the east village of manhattan

i've been a motorcycle owner for the

last 25 years

um speaking on behalf of the owners of

motorcycles in the five boroughs

and the reasons i believe that

motorcycles should be exempt

from the congestion pricing plan

is

firstly that motorcycles reduce traffic

congestion

also motorcycles get a great gas mileage

they take up a fraction of space than

cars about five or six to one on the

road and in parking

they're lightweight

helps reduce wear on the roads and

infrastructure of the city

and almost every other city around the

world where

they have congestion pricing motorcycles

have been exempt from those charges

including london which everyone loves to

speak about

also i believe that all residents of

lower manhattan should be exempt from

the congestion pricing as well as it is

a discriminatory tax

to those who have been living here for

like myself for over 45 years and um i

think that um it's uh yeah for sure

needs to be uh

thought out and considered

that all residents regardless of income

should be exempt except for the uber

rich which i don't know you know that's

another story but um also we need more

motorcycle parking and that being said i

am an avid and lifelong cyclist and i

ride my bicycle

around the city

seven days a week and i only use my

motorcycle maybe once or twice a week or

once or twice every every other week

so um

that being said i do support some sort

of

congestion addressing issue i don't know

whether it's this pricing scheme which

seems like a big burden and not

necessarily the best plan overall for

reducing traffic in manhattan and i'd

also like to thank the senator and

assembly people for supporting the

exemptions for residents thank you very

much

===

good evening ladies and gentlemen

my name is david warren i live in

midtown west manhattan

and

i am a supporter of congestion pricing

the plan

considering that we have global warming

and climate uh change and we in this

district is

the united nations

so that even

more so we should be supporting this

especially with the un climate chain

um many many of us have nicknamed our

area carmageddon because the cars are so

bad and congestion is so bad that we

need decongestion

um

as far as carve outs i think this should be

the least amount of carve outs

as possible

i understand that some of the unions

rightfully

want some of their uniform members such

as police officers and firefighter

sanitation who come into the district to

have a call out what i would suggest is

rather than carving out with their motor

car is to give them

free

rides on the public transit or there's a

long island railroad or the um subways

rather than um

giving them a callback to come

with their cars let them come by train

and bus and and and have it and let them

do it for free this way they don't even

have to take their car um because they

are middle class and you know they don't

make a great salary um

oh 30 seconds already all right i would

like to reiterate my support for

this

it makes common sense

um

to have this not just even for people

outside the district it would make their

flow much easier and it would help

businesses cranes cranes have said and i

support

100 percent what christine bertay said

uh clayton slavin from the rpa and

charles commodore i support them

so please support this thank you 

===

good evening my name is rachel foss and

i'm the senior research analyst for re

invent albany we advocate for more

transparent and accountable new york

government including for authorities

like the mta

re invent albany strongly supports

timely implementation of congestion

pricing because it is the law and has

been shown globally to reduce motor

vehicle congestion air pollution and

travel time for public transit as a big

bonus new york city congestion pricing

will provide the mta with a reliable

environmentally beneficial source of

revenue the metro region needs now to

fix our subways buses and computer rails

implementing congestion pricing is not a

discretionary act of the mta congestion

pricing was enacted into law by our

elected representatives in the state

legislature and signed by the governor

in 2019 with the support of the city

council

the business community transit experts

and environmental advocates

congestion pricing will raise 15 billion

dollars for the mta's 2020 capital plan

80 of which will fund new york city

transit 10

and will fund long island railroad and

10 metro north railroad

the law also allows certain exemptions

to tolls such as for emergency vehicles

and qualified vehicles transporting

persons with disabilities additionally a

separate tax credit was created for

residents in the zone earning less than

sixty thousand dollars annually it is

important that any tolling proposal

adopted by the mta not expand upon these

exemptions decisions around exemptions

must be seen as fair and transparent

because granting exemptions to certain

groups and not others could breed

cynicism about quid pro quo's related to

the interest groups that are the most

politically powerful congestion pricing

funds are the single largest component

of the capital plan and as noted in our

august 2020 or august 2021 report

capital planning funding for the 2020

capital plan is coming in at the slowest

pace of the last three plans

today only 3.6 billion has been received

out of a 55 billion plan if the mta

wants to make meaningful progress on its

capital plan it needs congestion pricing

to be implemented as soon as possible

lastly we ask that advisory processes be

transparent and documents related to

those

===

good evening i'm alex zomlovich senior

resource

senior research associate at citizens

budget commission a non-profit think

tank a non-profit non-partisan think

tank watchdog dedicated to constructive

budget and policy change in new york and

at the mta

cpc has long supported congestion

pricing which should begin as soon as

possible

manhattan today suffers nearly 5 billion

in congestion related losses every year

congestion pricing will reduce those

travel time losses and air pollution

while generating 1 billion annually for

mta capital

our online report getting the pricing

right offers six recommendations for

implementation

one prioritize reducing congestion and

emissions not just raising revenue alone

varying tolls to target the most

congested travel periods will best

reduce congestion and emissions within

the revenue goal two limit new

exemptions to transit providers and

perhaps for hire vehicles and taxis

proliferating exemptions could slow

program goal achievement and risk

popular support among those required to

pay higher consequent charges results

should be monitored to ensure policy

neutrality between private cars taxis

and fire vehicles

three do not provide any other types of

toll credits for the same reasons as

above with respect to exemptions

vary tolls by time of day and day of the

week while ensuring it's comprehensible

and well communicated clear

communication helps drivers shift trips

away from congested times as intended by

the law

five consider charging a vehicle miles

traveled fee for trips that stay inside

the zone

while the tech for vmt fees may not be

feasible at launch a future vmt fee

would advance program goals and

importantly remove endzone vehicles de

facto exemption from the charge for

trips that do not cross the boundary of

a cordon tool

six report outcomes to inform future

toll adjustments which we made regularly

like in singapore to ensure the program

minimizes congestion and emissions

within its revenue target effective

implementation targets congestion

emissions and revenue together not just

revenue alone in a fair and sustainable

manner that limits examples your remarks

maximizes social benefits uh

and so and maximizes social benefits we

support speedy implementation to reduce

uh and achieve these goals improve

transit for all new yorkers 

===

hello can you hear me

hello yes

my name is david lawrence um i am a

resident of lower manhattan for over 40

years i live at grand and crosby street

between soho and little italy and my

family is surrounded by broadway canal

and broome streets some of the loudest

most congested and most polluted streets

in our city so i very strongly support

the reasoning behind congestion pricing

however i do not agree with some of the

implementation that's being discussed

i believe that all residents

living below 60th street should be

exempt from this tax which should be

based on reducing congestion

not penalizing people for where they

live

i own a car in manhattan but i very

rarely drive it in manhattan

there is effectively no street parking

in my neighborhood so my car is kept in

a garage that i pay for

it's only on the street when i leave

my area to do

jobs i'm a photographer and i have gear

to carry whenever i leave this the area

to go to new jersey long island

connecticut to do jobs i need my car

i also have children in college that

need to be transported

i use my car approximately two to three

days a month

um under this plan i'm told that i will

be charged a daily fee

whether i'm driving or not

this will nearly or nearly triple the

cost my annual cost of owning a car

and

only approximately seven to eight

percent will be

accrued from actually driving in

manhattan the rest

92 or 93 will be because my car is

parked off the street that does not seem

fair it seems incredibly punitive i ask

you to please reconsider um adjusting

this to accommodate manhattan residents

below 60th street and offer us a blanket

exemption thank you for your time

===

hi thank you very much for letting me

speak

my name is russell squire i'm the chair

of community board 8 manhattan i'm

speaking on behalf of community board 8

which encompasses both sides of the

border of the congestion pricing zone to

strongly urge that the traffic mobility

review board include and be required to

include

two members from manhattan one from

below 60th street and one from above

60th street

currently there are requirements that

representatives of mta regions outside

of new york city be represented on the

traffic mobility review board as should

be obvious though congestion pricing

will have a significant impact on

manhattan where the congestion pricing

zone is located this impact will be felt

both within and outside of the

congestion pricing zone as the rules and

methods are developed for how congestion

pricing will be implemented it is

essential that manhattan be represented

on the board to ensure that the issues

that will control manhattan as a result

of congestion pricing will be taken into

account because congestion pricing will

have major and different impacts on the

areas of manhattan inside and outside of

the congestion pricing zone both of

those areas of manhattan should be

represented

the mta and the traffic mobility review

board should take the interests and

concerns of manhattan into account

formulating the rules and methods that

will apply to congestion pricing again

we urge that the traffic mobility review

board include and be required to include

going forward to members from manhattan

one from below 60th street and one from

above thank you very much

===

my name is anne seligman um i'm sir been

rewriting my testimony on the fly in

response to what i've heard

i'm one of those who live in the cbd and

have a car but rarely use it within

manhattan

like larry shire i am a member of the of

cb6 but speaking as an individual

way more folks than i expected support

this idea as i do

regardless of

its personal financial impact

but i believe the benefits in improving

air quality and health reducing

congestion and vehicle emissions and

especially raising funds for public

transit that the vast majority of new

yorkers use including my myself

um so far if you have mentioned that cbd

border crossing rates should be traffic

or at least time sensitive i think

that's critical

rates that don't change based on either

time or traffic levels or just at all

don't encourage drivers to ship there

and don't encourage drivers to shift

their behavior in time

and that's what reduces congestion

it's also critical that revenue from

this program

is managed through a very specific

lock box or go directly to the mta

rather than any general funds i know

it's in the legislation but sometimes

things slap

finally tolling should be entrance

neutral regard independent of which

roads tunnels or bridges drivers are

using

traffic air quality and

dangerous health conditions are

significantly worse around free bridges

and tolls

this is against my interest as a user of

the 59th street bridge but i care more

about the health and air quality of my

fellow new yorkers than my personal

finances

i'm glad to hear that our elected

officials are so engaged and supportive

thank you and good luck with your outer

borough and uptown hearings

===

hi my name is john marsh i'm a lifelong

resident of peter cooper village

stuyvesant town living in the zone

i'm an inline skater biker pedestrian

public transit user

and an automobile owner

we all need to learn to share our

streets equitably

i support congestion pricing

however we who live in the zone do not

contribute to the problem this program

strives to solve

our vehicles mostly sit idle

except for when we leave the zone and

return to it

our mobility challenged and disabled

need automobile transportation to get to

medical appointments

we ask that the t

mrb find ways to reduce the financial

impact on those

living within the zone

thank you

===

um this is peter sullivan i live and

grew up in new york city i've been here

for 65 years

um i don't think that this

congestion pricing really addresses the

problem of congestion

the congestion that i see in the city is

uber lyft cars

double parked trucks making deliveries

causing congestion

and just

it's mostly from those things

this doesn't really address those things

there's also a problem

with

the elimination of the com muter attacks

which happened many years ago but maybe

we should use this opportunity to

re-implement portions of that concept

my proposal would be allow manhattan

residents to drive and enter manhattan

freely as long as their cars were

registered in manhattan

their ez pass device could be triggered

to show that they live in manhattan for

outer borough residents there could be a

charge if they want to pay for unlimited

use of manhattan streets say 120 a year

if they decided not to it wouldn't be

put onto their

uh easy pass

other

metro north commuter line people suffolk

nasa westchester could also pay say

something like 200 a year

anyone else coming in for the day or

whatever would be subject to a fee

and

all you'd have to do is

put up

a limited number of readers on the

bridges

so i i think that uh

really have

choke points in this city the midtown

tunnel the 59th street bridge the

lincoln tunnel the holland tunnel those

places are where

you need additional traffic cops and

additional resources to ease the traffic

in those areas but congestion pricing

just generally across the board across

half the island is meaningless

thank you

===

hello can you hear me

yes

hi my name is andrew soltis and i'm a

resident of 36th street and 9th avenue

like nearly 80 percent of manhattan

residents i do not own a car

despite non-car owners being an extreme

majority we find ourselves surrounded by

congestion 9th avenue is a literal

parking lot every afternoon

living right next to the tunnel cars are

constantly blocking crosswalks and

creating unsafe conditions even for just

walking across the street to the corner

store

we need cleaner air and safer streets we

need to improve our public

transportation infrastructure we need

more dedicated bus lanes and bike lanes

we need to fight climate change as our

city continues to flood

congestion and pricing will help with

all of these issues we were promised it

would start in january of this year we

understand the trump administration and

covid delayed things but it's time to

move quickly please please hurry up we

do not need to study the obvious anymore

congestion is making our city

demonstrably worse please get this done

as soon as possible the conversation

about exemptions is a distraction if you

choose to own a car to drive your to

your vacation property twice a month you

can pay a toll

if you don't want to take public transit

to get to the airport you can pay the

toll if you choose to enroll your

children in a private school in another

neighborhood rather than your zoned

school you can pay the toll to drive

them there

if you're in a car you are the traffic

we do not need any exemptions beyond the

existing exemptions for people with

disabilities and people making below 60k

hearing earlier tonight that we are

still going in the planning and public

comment phase in 2023 is upsetting we

have been waiting a long time for this

please hurry thank you

===

hi can you hear

me yes yes

um hi okay so

my name's jason brigham and i'm a

resident of flatiron and have been so

for the past 16 years

we purchased a home to raise our

daughter under a set of rules that did

not include a penalty for simply coming

home

for those of you who live in the suburbs

imagine putting a tollbooth at the end

of your driveway that charges you nine

to twenty dollars to simply come home

based on the time of day

first

let's stop calling it a congestion price

and start calling it what it really is

it's a tax on people living below 60th

street when you charge someone to enter

at 2 am when there's no congestion you

realize this has very little to do with

congestion and more to do with a money

grab from manhattan residents if you

need proof look at the taxi charge we've

been paying for the last two years all

times of the day three o'clock in the

morning even when there's no congestion

there are so many things wrong with this

i'll hit a couple of the most obvious

while i have a minute left

first it's going to distort the real

estate market around 60th street imagine

looking at two similar apartments on

58th and 62nd street which one would you

buy

if one would penalize you for coming

home and cost you hundreds or thousands

of dollars per year

number two how much more will products

below 60th street cost when delivery

drivers have to pay a huge tax to get in

and deliver products to this to the

small businesses that are below 60th

number three has anyone thought about

the horribly ugly gantries on literally

every street below 60th how about the

people living in those neighborhoods

that have to look at those every day how

about the strobe lights on the gantries

in the tunnels it's one thing when they

go off every time a car goes by to take

a picture of their license plate but for

someone who's a neighbor at 3 am trying

to sleep doesn't seem very nice to me

nobody's mentioned number 5 that there

will be something like 75 plus sets of

gantries installed around the bottom

part of manhattan

how much does that cost to build and

maintain they're not free to run you

know they take electricity you have to

change the strobe lights cameras

probably get muddy in the rain how about

enforcement for those who don't have

easy pass someone has to chase all these

stop trying to soak people below 60th

for yet another tax and give anyone

who's a resident a full exemption from

the tax if you want to implement it cut

down on commuters

keep in mind the ugly gantries and

lifestyle issues 

===

hi i'm jonathan frank

i've been a resident of this

below

congestion pricing district for over 30

years my wife and i chose to live here

we raised our kids here we sent them to

public school here

we support our local businesses as we

have for 30 years

hearing what i do now

it makes me wonder why we didn't choose

61st or 62nd street

it sounds amazing to me and i echo all

of the thoughts that were just raised

about businesses

about

people we support who are employed in

this neighborhood

who have to get here and

to be clear about myself i am retired

i used my car to get out of the city i

did to care for my elderly

parents on almost daily basis i still do

to get out to care for family and

friends i get out to go exercise at road

at randall's island to which there is no

convenient mass transit or i would

gladly use it

so it is an unfair punishment to all of

us below 60th unless we take into

account what we've actually learned from

london

there's been a lot of talk about london

but it's clear that nobody who's

actually thought of this is in the weeds

there because there is a 90 percent

discount 90 percent discount you can

look at it under westminister.gov

dot uk for all residents in the

congestion pricing area and guess what

it's been an enormous success they've

lowered congestion pollution they have

support from both the community and the

community businesses and it's been very

successful and this is not a model this

is something that's been going on for

15 16 17 years this is real life

so i urge you to consider that and

consider the residents who already paid

any taxes who pay for their cars to be

here and who had no idea when they

bought residences here that they would

be subject just for driving to leave the

city to a tax

===

thank you very much my name is

cecil scheib i live in alphabet city

i have a four-year-old and i get around

manhattan without a car i do it by

walking or by biking and for the people

who have to implement this i ask you to

take a four-year-old in a bike seat

around manhattan streets to school or

playgrounds and see how safe you feel in

the crowded and swollen streets

filled with congestion

this uh toll won't apply

to people just

taking the fdr once again i challenge

you to take a toddler to east river park

and try to enjoy it next to the honking

and diesel fumes of idling

bumper-to-bumper traffic that is

congestion two and a s and most of all

affects the eg areas next to the fdr on

the on the lower east side sorry i live

in i live in alphabet city um there are

so many cars they are forcing each other

to take increasingly dangerous maneuvers

cars are getting bigger and bigger this

is what my

son has to deal with cars where the

bottom of the hood is taller than his

head

i think the pricing should take the size

of the car into

account that's how much space you take

up take up more space you should pay

more and my feeling is if you drive once

in a while nine dollars is not a large

amount and if you drive every day for

some reason then you are

also part of the problem and everyone

should have to should have to contribute

when i travel out of manhattan to new

jersey or long island or other boroughs

i use transit

other folks can do the same we make we

those of us without cars find ways to

get around the time savings is going to

pay for the price if you're a small

business person you can afford nine

dollars not to stay in traffic for 45

minutes to drive 20 blocks like we read

in the news if you live in manhattan and

drive to westchester nine dollars seems

fair to me

thanks let's do it with no exceptions it

helps us all my four-year-old and i

thank you

===

hi i'm lee berman democratic district

leader from the grand street democrats

located on the lower east side of

manhattan if congestion pricing is

implemented there must be an exemption

for all residents of lower manhattan

those of us who live here should not

have to pay an additional tax on top of

the taxes and fees we are already forced

to pay

our elected officials seem not to give a

damn about the working middle class as

they wave around an exemption for low

income and disabled residents except

that many in manhattan and here in our

very community require the use of a car

whether to get to and from their job to

get to doctor's appointments to visit

family because relatives live too far to

visit on unsafe and unreliable mass

transit or because taking a family of

four or six or eight on buses and trains

for two to three plus hours each way is

not possible for them

congestion pricing will further tax the

working middle class of lower manhattan

rather than charging those non-city

residents that come into the city the

entire city as well as the central

business district and then use our

resources without paying for them roads

police fire sewer water etc we will have

to pay an additional tax for them

one of the things the pandemic has shown

is that more and more residents who can

will leave but not everyone has that

luxury and those working middle class

residents who don't have the ability to

just get up and move are the ones who

will be most negatively affected

every lower manhattan resident will now

have to pay higher prices for everyday

goods and services our local bodegas

supermarkets and other stores are not

going to eat the increased fees that

they have to pay for deliveries every

store is going to pass along the cost of

their suppliers transportation to all of

us in lower manhattan and let's also

remember how we got here we've got

former assembly speaker sheldon silver

to thank for what has been described as

quote one of the dumbest most harmful

political moves in new york history when

he moved in 1999 to repeal the commuter

tax draining billions of dollars from

city coffers that could have been used

to maintain public transportation we

also conclude your remarks

and state governments have for

generations squandered billions this

won't be any different thank you

===

uh yeah hello

we can hear you all right yeah my name

is kirk roger i'm a third year student

at brooklyn law school and a turtle bay

resident and i'm here in complete

support of congestion pricing uh you

know we have a tremendous opportunity

here to massively improve the quality of

life in our city

and not only will congestion pricing

bring much-needed funds to help improve

the transit system which i think

everyone here

can agree is sorely needed

but it will also dramatically reduce the

number of cars in the city and thereby

improve all of our lives through safer

streets uh more revenue for local

business from increased foot traffic

better air quality less noise

and more reliable transit uh you know

some people have

criticized this plan as a tax on the

working class but the number of of

low-income and middle-income people who

drive in the cbd is about 120th

the population of those same groups that

will benefit from this plan

um you know some people have also

believed that it will make living in the

area somehow more expensive but this

really

can't be the case because the proposed

charge is at most 20 standard districts

so even if the delivery companies are

pushing all of their costs

on onto the

consumers that's only gonna be about one

cent per purchase

um

you know i also don't understand the

argument that uh people who live here

will uh only use their cars to leave the

city

they're they're making the same trip as

all the commuters are it's just in

reverse their impact is no different

they're still part of the problem and so

they should still be subject to the same

charge

um

there's no reason why nearly all people

who pay this charge could not take

public transit a bike for their own two

feet

and

this uh congestion charge even at the

highest proposed price doesn't come

close to being equal to the negative

externalities that come with driving a

car car crashes are the leading cause of

death among americans under 35 including

children and

please i i beg of you do right by our

community ensure that this congestion

charge is a strong deterrent to driving

thank you

===

uh i live in the west village i have

resided south of 23rd street for most of

the last 30 years

i love new york and look forward to our

city regaining its prior luster but it

will not do so if the government

continues to ask its middle class

residents to bear any more of the burden

than we do already

congestion pricing affords the city an

opportunity to ease traffic and gain

revenue

but it has to be done in a way to not

penalize those of us who live south of

60th street it has been proposed that a

sixty thousand dollar threshold should

be used as a maximum income to avoid

such a tax and that is what it is a tax

all of us pay new york city and new york

state income taxes at a rate close to

the top for the country we pay one of

the highest sales tax rates as well

after those taxes and the cost of

renting or buying in new york do you

honestly think citizens should be asked

to bear the burden of congestion pricing

most of us use our cars as you've

already heard to leave the city do you

think we use it to go to west 35th

street so we can pay 30 dollars to park

for for an hour or two i am a

shareholder in a co-op i have owned it

for 11 years and i and my fellow

shareholders pay real estate taxes every

year there is no congestion pricing fee

now but on an ex post-facto basis i will

be asked to pay for having a car

a tax that was not in effect when i

moved to the village those of us who

have lived here should not be hit for

staying in our homes and not leaving the

city as many have if you want to be fair

and i assume you do car owners below

60th street should be exempted from this

onerous tax we are not the cause of the

congestion

thank you

===

yes can you hear me

yes we can

yeah i just thought i am a resident of

hell's kitchen and

as someone said it's a fallacy these

people who are claiming that everyone

who uses a car in manhattan is a wealthy

person using it to go to their vacation

home or take their child to uh private

school

think of the photographer who mentioned

he needs a car to get to work the

actress i myself at one point had to

keep a car because i had a job that

required me to go to parts of new jersey

which are not accessible via public

transportation people on the

call who are claiming that you can get

everywhere public transportation

that's not true and residents who live

in the zone should not be penalized

because sometimes doing the things

part of daily life whether it be going

to work taking care of sick parents

visiting relatives at times requires a

car i have a friend who has an 88 year

old mother with alzheimer's who lives in

the bronx she's a widow the woman's an

only child their time she has to go and

care for her mother it takes an hour to

get there in public transportation if

her mother has an emergency or her

mother wants to visit her 85 year old

sister in westchester she has

alzheimer's she's on a walker she can't

take metro north her daughter has to

take her in a car so now her daughter is

a good daughter and helps her she has to

pay a toll or tax for coming home and

sleeping in her own bed at night similar

to the other folks on the call

now if they go to work in their car and

you happen to be a photographer and you

have to take your equipment well now you

have to pay a tax to come and sleep in

your own bed at night it's not fair

i'm not against the concept of

congestion pricing and the environmental

aspects but it has to be applied in a

way that residents live south of 60th

street are not unfairly paying a tax

just to go about their daily lives and

at times that requires a car because

public transportation is insufficient

thank you

===

oh great i just want to say i live in

peter cooper stuyvesant town i've been

born and raised here

and you know i feel like i'm already

being taxed by living in the city uh

there's an added fee on your

registration for an mta

you know help out the mta

when you get into a taxi cab or uber you

are

taxed for riding in a cab uh and there's

the mta mobility tax on employees that

work in the city

you know

my opinion is they need to fix the mta

they put in biometric uh

clocks for the employees to check in

punch in punch out they ruin them

i invite any one of you transmit

advocates to ride on the l train

at four o'clock in the morning

because that's what time i get home from

work i'm leaving for work and there's

homelessness and there's violence on the

trains that's what forces me to have to

drive from manhattan to brooklyn to work

i'm scared of the change i'll be

truthful with you you know i'm six foot

two 200 pounds but you know what it

still worries me on what i see on the

trains

i'm not i'm not against the mobility or

tax

for

you know congestion pricing tax but do

it fairly please i mean you know

consider the people that live

in this neighborhood that have lived in

this neighborhood

we should be grandfathered uh maybe the

people that are here before it was in

place should be grandfathered new people

moving in should be aware of it

i know that's just my two cents thank

you for listening have a good night

===

good evening

thank you for letting me speak

i'm a resident of downtown manhattan i

live in seaport area

and it's an area that suffers from large

amounts of traffic congestion on a daily

basis which has gotten much worse in the

past two decades

do you hear me

hello

yes we do okay

um thank you

um

i see the need to limit the number of

cars on the road and can appreciate the

idea that tolling these river bridges

can fund the subways

but i believe that those of us who live

in manhattan uh should be exempted from

paying a congestion pricing the same way

other people who are coming into

manhattan from outside manhattan are are

being asked to pay that so i think that

we ought to have an exemption because i

don't i own a car but i share my car

with my family and we don't you know we

we pay for a garage and we pay for all

the all the expenses of the car

but uh and we've had it for a long time

we used it to escape the manhattan uh

during uh 9 11 and uh dur after

hurricane after 9 11 and after hurricane

sandy and there are not many ways off

the island of manhattan so having the

option of using a car is important my

son has a car he uses it to commute

please um exempt us from

uh having to pay this congestion pricing

we live here we pay

taxes and we are part of the middle

class um this should not be happening to

those people who are inside the zone

thank you very much

===

uh okay i am um a resident

of hell's kitchen and i totally

understand the congestion and and

everything that people have said about

this but i also do own a car

and i also

agree with people

who say that you know not everyone who

owns a car

is

somehow has a country home and

has a lot of money and so then we should

be penalized i could say the same thing

about people who try to raise a family

here

uh and want clean air we don't raise a

family new york city if you really want

the clean air that's then you go to the

suburbs you know we could we could turn

that around uh but you know i think

everyone has a right to to live in this

city and the way they want to and i

believe there should be some kind of

exemption

of some kind for people who do only use

their car to get out of the city

uh or absolutely need it to help family

um and you know we keep hearing how it's

gonna improve the public transit system

well i would love to see proof of that

um if i truly believe that the money

would be used to to improve the transit

system that would be great and if we

could maybe just sort of implement that

over time i think you're going to get a

lot more buy-in as we see the transit

system get better and then i think

people won't be as worried about

spending the money so

um i am definitely for clearing up

congestion because i raised my family

here as well

and it is horrible here on 9th avenue

but i think there has to be some kind of

moderation and i have that there has to

be buy-in and i think you do that in

incrementally and not just all or

nothing uh thank you for letting me

speak

===

i'm sorry i was hitting all the wrong

buttons sorry

thanks i'm uh rob burns i'm president of

the east midtown partnership which is a

business improvement district on

manhattan's east side

uh and includes an area

bisected by the

proposed or by the tolling

zone border between 60th and 61st street

my board of directors has not yet

adopted a position statement on the

central business district uh tolling

program

but i'd like to to briefly uh address

some concerns from the community that

i've worked with for 20 years

and i also by the way think i might be

the only person primarily representing

the business community tonight

um

in east midtown we know traffic

congestion

our district is subject to not only

having midtown traffic but also we're

located on the west side of the

queensborough bridge

and just east of the crosstown

chokepoint created by central park

disincentives to drive personal vehicles

into midtown are laudable

but it's important to keep in mind that

people live and work in the blocks north

and south of 60th and 61st street

as a plan is devised to discourage

traffic

please don't inordinately penalize them

because of their existing location

a few specifics

commercial vehicles originating from the

vicinity of the total zone border

should only be subject to the same once

a day

toll as passenger vehicles

residents in the general vicinity of the

tolling zone border who who have

vehicles should be eligible for the same

tax credit as lower income drivers since

they'll have no choice but to regularly

cross that border and although the

proposals are undergoing what we hope

will be a vigorous environmental

assessment

follow-up studies should be mandatory

the creation of the tooling zone will

inevitably result please conclude your

remarks in heavy idling and circling

traffic on both sides of the border

thank you for this opportunity written

remarks will also follow thank you

thank you

===

my name is rachel goddard and i am a

fifth generation

resident of the proposed central

business district and art mass transit

supporter and rider

i question why this plan chooses to

charge residents of the cbd who use

personal vehicles on occasion to leave

the city for returning to their homes

when we do not make up the majority of

the traffic on cbd streets and yet says

nothing about taxi and rideshare users

grabbing a ride from the financial

district to times square

both within the cbd and thus not

impacted by this proposed toll greatly

contributing to congestion even when bus

and subway options are plentiful within

the cbd

the rise in rideshare riders correlates

with the decrease in the riders on mta

buses the rise in rideshare cars

circulating our streets or what

correlates with the rise in the number

of cars in manhattan limiting ride

shares in manhattan restricting them to

pick up the pickups in the outer

boroughs only the way the green taxis

were intended to and then charging these

vehicles a toll to enter manhattan would

be more effective at tackling the route

of the problem

yellow cabs could still operate in

manhattan however these rides could also

be charged this new toll even for trips

solely within the cbd

this would encourage riders to take mass

transit within manhattan and from the

outer boroughs into manhattan

at a time when the city has cut bus

service in parts of the outer boroughs

forcing residents to drive to get to

work in school it is disingenuous to

pretend the proposed central business

district tolling program is in the name

of decongestion

it is suspicious to me that this

presentation has avoided commenting on

the negative impact of private

enterprises such as uber and lyft on our

city's quality of life rather has

focused on commuters and resident car

owners infrastructure development is

needed before this tolling program is

implemented not the other way around

thank you

===

hi this is valentina jones

can you hear me

yes

okay

uh my name is valentina jones and i'm

here on behalf of the lower east side

power partnership uh we are advocating

for exemptions for trucks bringing

prescribed medications over-the-counter

medications food and household supplies

to pharmacies such as cbs and rite aid

as well as grocery stores and zip 102

zip 102 is mainly a residential area and

not a central business district our

concern is that any tolls the trucks

have to pay will likely be transferred

through inflated prices to the residents

of zip 102 who need these items

uh and

personally i have to say i'm a retired

registered nurse and i really would not

like to see

people come into the hospital because

they have not been taking their

medication because they cannot afford it

uh that should not be the reason why

somebody's blood pressure spike somebody

has a cardiac

condition etc that they should be able

to afford their meds thank you

thank you

===

okay

my name is nancy sharon i am a senior

citizen who lives in manhattan south of

60th street where i have lived and

worked most of my life

calling this district a central business

district ignores the residential

neighborhoods that coexist with

businesses they have a population the

size of a mid-sized city and are home to

people of all income levels let's find

another name for this project

it is not fair to single out one small

part of new york city for tolling when

other places in the region also benefit

from mta services and have congestion

and air pollution

tolling will have only a marginal effect

on reducing traffic and air pollution as

there are many factors causing these

problems it is clear that the primary

goal is to raise funds for the mta's

capital plan

funding should come from the entire

region

to designate a fixed amount to be raised

and to adjust the tolls to achieve that

amount will penalize success

if the problem if the program is

successful and reduces traffic tolls

will be raised continuously

with tolling the cost of living and

doing business will go up causing prices

everywhere in the district to rise this

will hurt business and residents and

will put the district at a disadvantage

compared to other areas

where are incentives for the mta to keep

costs down and to get projects done

quickly

how can we

be assured that the mta will provide the

services we need currently i am not

always a satisfied customer we need a

balanced approach to road management

that includes cars they fill gaps where

public transportation is not sufficient

the mta cannot do this alone city and

state agencies must coordinate a

practical plan to manage the roadways

and reduce congestion

thank you for the opportunity to speak

===

uh my name is anne beaumont

and i live in lower manhattan and i work

in times square and i

am an enthusiastic user of the services

that the mta to mta provides and i'm

generally in favor of congestion

charging in manhattan but i'd like to

bring a perspective to bear that i don't

think has been touched upon tonight

at all

imposing congestion charges at least in

full

on taxis

lyft uber dial seven and the like makes

no sense

these types of services taxis and car

services are themselves a form of mass

transportation they take private cars

off the streets

making them more expensive doesn't take

them off the streets

as a manhattan car owner i regularly

face the choice between using my own car

and taking a taxi or car service

not

as a choice between my car and the

subway you want me to choose taxi or car

service not and not to use my car

also

taking a taxi or car service often is a

matter of personal safety

particularly for women

we cannot ride the subway alone in the

middle of the night

we often leave our workplaces late at

night and in places that are underserved

by subways and we need to get home

safely

and sometimes we even go out at night

and we need to get home safely then too

making it cost nearly three times more

than it once did which already was a lot

just to sit down in a taxi or car

service makes our city less safe to

navigate particularly for women it is

also important to have reasonably

affordable taxis and car services for

tourists as the subway can be baffling

for out-of-towners and again making

taxis and car services more expensive

doesn't take them off the street in

short a policy that deters people from

taking taxis and car services by making

them more expensive doesn't further the

goals of congestion sharpening charging

and makes our city less safe please

remove or discount the congestion

charges on these types of services thank

you

===

hello

my name is ruth fassolt and i am a

senior policy manager for new york at

lyft i'm also a resident of the

congestion zone i've been here for over

a decade

lyft is a long time supporter of

universal congestion pricing in fact

for higher vehicles such as those on the

lyft platform have been paying a

congestion fee since early 2019.

as part of the

2018-2019 congestion pricing program for

hire vehicles pay 275 per trip for a

zone that's actually larger than the

zone we're talking about today the fees

for that all start south of 96th street

in 2020 these congestion fees raised 384

million dollars for the mta

tlc vehicles are the only cars on the

roads currently paying a congestion fee

personal vehicles unquestionably one of

the largest groups on the road do not

utility vehicles do not delivery

vehicles do not

it's important to note that due to caps

the tlc instituted on licenses back in

2018 the number of for hired vehicles is

only going down

new cars are not being added and the

number of licenses is down nearly 20 000

in the last three years we understand

the importance of paying our fair share

on the creeps crowded streets of new

york we do not want rideshare to

shoulder the responsibility of paying

this fair share alone so we just asked

that the mta traffic mobility review

board as they look to set tolls for each

types of vehicles um look at the current

regulations and most importantly current

congestion fees that when they consider

tolls for four higher vehicles

thank you so much

===

hello everyone

can you hear me okay

we can hear you please begin your

remarks

yes hi

about the congestion pricing program

and as others have noted that this

i support those congestion pricing

program there's two caveats

residents below 60th street

should uh be

should it be should not be effect to not

be charged for

uh the

tolls

now

there is so much cause and there's so

much traffic and you know why

because of all this placard abuse the

abuse of over the abuse and the regular

cars themselves itself from federal

state

and city agencies about three two

hundred thousand such vehicles exist

many of them are legit

some are fake

some are

police officers association which is

bribed

by

obtaining a police surgeon fake placard

you have construction workers with vests

you have

hotel and doormen hotel workers and

doormen with notes that they're a

doorman you have security guards they're

also parked for free they park all over

for free and there's no place to park

new york city has just been

um unbearable

place

not only to park but just to drive here

if they could actually

reduce the car volume by telling people

if you live in the five boroughs and you

can go into

midtown

or lower manhattan you should be able to

take the subway and not drive in

no one should be no one should put up

with it right now there is too much

corruption and too much abuse

by all this government issue parking

placards and those are created on a

computer committing multiple felonies of

fake counterfeit parking placards all

over the place they take up space along

bike lanes

they take up space along the line of

sight of a buffer lanes or bike lanes

they take your bases along bus lanes

they take up a no standing spaces

fix the problem and then we can work on

contestant pricing itself thank you very

much have a good day

===

all right can you hear me okay

yes we can hear you okay my name is bob

friedrich and i'm president of glen oaks

village the largest garden apartment

co-op in new york with 10 000 residents

we are located in eastern queens a

transit desert without 24-hour transit

options many of our seniors and other

residents regularly travel into

manhattan for medical care or for other

personal reasons

these residents are working class folks

many on a fixed income many retired and

do not have the resources to pay these

crippling tolls

and then i find it so self-serving that

the vast majority of manhattan residents

providing testimony today

are fervent supporters of congestion

pricing but then demand that they be

exempt from congestion pricing that they

so fervently support

rather than being punitive i'd like to

present for your consideration five ways

we can mitigate the punitive effects of

congestion pricing that would constitute

an authentic congestion pricing plan

rather than a tax plan disguised as a

congestion pricing plan an authentic

congestion pricing plan should be about

reducing vehicular congestion and

spreading vehicular usage evenly

throughout the day and not simply about

raising

uh revenues they are told so number one

congestion pricing totals should be

limited to actual peak congestion hours

and direction 6 a.m to 10 a.m manhattan

bound only two congesting pricing tolls

should not be punitively expensive and

should be limited to the central

manhattan business district which is

really 14th street to 96th street three

no congestion pricing tolls on weekends

and holidays four no congestion pricing

tolls on handicapped permit tag holders

and five no congestion pricing calls or

significantly reduced rates on

motorcycles which do not create

congestion and are space efficient a

plan without these constraints is a tax

plan disguised as a congestion pricing

plan that will fall squarely on the

backs of our outer borough residents

thank you so much

===

hi i'm lisa dagley and executive

director of the permanent citizens

advisory committee to the mta pcac i'm

speaking

let's put my videos on okay i'm also

speaking as someone who's lived in

hell's kitchen for close to two decades

watching cars and trucks in traffic

light after light inching forward

spewing fumes buses stuck with them

making it faster to walk i still spend a

lot of time there and crossing the

street means cutting through traffic

that's back to pre-pandemic levels

now i live in queens where a lot of that

traffic comes from

watching the increasing number of

vehicles drives home the critical

importance of congestion pricing

the primary goal of congestion pricing

is to raise one billion dollars a year

that when bonded will contribute 15

billion dollars towards the mta's

capital program

that means the more exemptions the

higher the toll that's important to

remember as people begin that fight

the cbd benefits from riders coming from

all over the region by train and bus and

the transit system that brings them in

would benefit from the tolls that will

be charged by congestion pricing

it's only it's the only feasible way to

raise significant funds for the mta

without raising fares

bringing in a steady stream of money for

key improvements for subways buses

staten island railway long island

railroad and metro north

people who live in the cbd will also

benefit from congestion pricing with as

many as with as much as 20 percent less

traffic better air quality lower traffic

noise and faster travel times which will

also seriously help bus riders

congestion pricing funds can and should

be used to make the transit system more

resilient and protected against the

ravages of climate change

moreover thousands of essential projects

and jobs rely on the money it will bring

constant bumper-to-bumper traffic can be

a thing of the past improving quality of

life in faster commutes not just in the

cbd but all over the region

riders deserve reliable and frequent

service

thank you

ah good evening i am felicia park rogers

and i am the director of regional

infrastructure projects for tri-state

transportation campaign an advocacy and

policy organization fighting for

sustainable mobility in new york new

jersey and connecticut

we strongly support the implementation

of congestion pricing we've always

understood that congestion pricing is

not simply about the tolling system but

about the toll that traffic congestion

and air pollution exacts on the

livability of our city and the health

and well-being of our most vulnerable

communities

as one of the most climate vulnerable

and diverse coastal cities new york city

must lead the way for major cities

nationally and around the world

manhattan is at the front line of the

climate crisis that will continue to

negatively impact the entire city

torrential downpours and flash flooding

like we saw in recent weeks are expected

to occur more frequently and become even

more severe the cbd faces some of the

worst congestion in the city sam

schwartz found that traffic in the cbd

frequently averages a mere 4.6 miles per

hour this hurts not just the people

trying to move through the cbd but also

the most vital economic center of our

nation we must act now to reduce carbon

emissions from the transportation sector

and this starts with implementing

congestion pricing not only is this a

win for the environment and for public

health it's also a win for millions of

transit riders who rely on a transit

system that needs new revenue streams to

build its multi-billion dollar capital

campaign program

within the 30 counties that make up the

project study area 52

are people of color and 13 of residents

have household incomes below the poverty

line

in 2019 tri-state published fact sheets

analyzing how many commuters for each of

the 140 state assembly and senate

districts in the mp mta service area

would be affected by congestion pricing

you can see these reports on our website

www.tstc.org

and they show that it's a very small

percentage who will be affected

while congestion and pricing by itself

won't solve every transportation

challenge our city faces it is an

integral part of a larger strategy to

make urban transportation

almost done more efficient sustainable

and equitable

tri-state has been fighting for

congestion pricing for well over a

decade and now is the time we cannot

afford to delay any longer thank you

thank you

good good good good good evening my name

is christopher schuyler i'm a senior

staff attorney uh disability justice

program

at new york lawyers for public interest

i'm a person who stutters

new york lawyers for public interest

supports the goals and benefits of

congestion pricing as this landmark

policy will reduce climate emissions and

toxic air pollution

increase traffic speeds and raise

critical revenue for the mta in fact the

mta is relying on congestion pricing to

fund 15 billion of the 55 billion uh

2020 2024 capital plan it's the single

largest source of funds for the plan the

leading priority of the plan is to

implement desperately needed

accessibility improvements throughout

the largely inaccessible subway system

however congestion pricing law is vague

as to who from the disability community

will benefit from the exemption

what groups are captured by the phrase

qualifying vehicles transporting people

with disabilities uh what while we

assume it means that at least successful

ride in opw

ddd vehicles what about wheelchair

accessible uh cabs for higher vehicles

what about personal vehicles owned and

operated by

people with disabilities or those

transporting non-vehicle owning people

with disabilities the mta must state

publicly who will be covered under this

exemption but moreover while we know

that congestion pricing

will raise 15 billion to the capital

plan what portion of that will go to

accessibility improvements of the total

55 billion plan at least 10 billion is

directly earmarked for station

accessibility improvements

um the disability community should be

told what portion of the funding raised

by congestion pricing will go to

accessibility improvements

uh we are uh in support of condition

price uh congestion pricing at uh for

climate and congestion benefits

for the benefits it will bring to

disadvantaged communities in a near new

york city currently traffic gridlock

slows many of our transit buses and

paratransit vehicles to a mere crawl

so in closing the mta must clarify who

is covered by the disability exemption

and state what amount of funds uh raised

will go to accessibility improvements

with estimation of your remarks with

that information club public the startup

of congestion pricing should be treated

as an urgent priority so that new

yorkers can begin to benefit from

reduced emissions in gridlock thank you

===

excellent i'd like to begin by thanking

all the people who've made to take their

time out to be here tonight but also to

bring attention to the massive amount of

problems and negligences that have gone

on throughout the uh metropolitan

transit authority i'm not really here

to uh speak highly of this my family's

been in new york for generations and

we've had to deal with an entity that

has had 100 years to electrify 60 miles

worth of track and has not done it yet

in inbound squabbling and the ability to

disappear more money than anybody

reasonable

any reasonable entity would be allowed

to without audit cannot go on any

further i would like everybody in

attendance to consider this a public

notice of demand of audit

i live out on long island and i've had

to sleep in my truck and outside in the

city to go do art that was made illegal

during the pandemic and even now the

mayor's office and other mta things are

using the public i'm sorry the

intellectual property of artists and

then hassling them

this is unacceptable and by no later

than uh october 31st of this year we

need to have a tangible

audit of everything that's been going on

we're not doing this anymore i'm not

going to hear why people are drowning in

illegal apartments while the mta has

pump trucks that have never been used

and have sat there rotting

for 10 years you could we couldn't put

somebody who needed to go to work

to do that

this is unacceptable

i have no way to get off of my island

and we are trapped and i'm telling you

right now none of us are paying any more

money to go to work we have people who

have tangible assets that have to come

and go and we have people who can work

from home and they're not going back on

the train none of us are okay the well

you can't brag about a lot a crap on

time

uh

schedule a 50

you know capacity nobody wants to use it

thank you and have a wonderful day

===

hi did you call me i didn't even hear

that

lisa orman is it my turn

okay great thank you so much

okay hi my name is lisa orman i work at

open plans a policy and advocacy

organization working to make our city

more livable

i'm a parent have lived in the city for

25 years work downtown and commute

multiple times a day to the central

living district my kids go to school in

chelsea

like most new yorkers we commute with

our feet and on the train

when we exit the subway at 28th street

and walk across 8th 9th and 10th avenues

our stress levels go through the roof

how can anyone actually call 10th avenue

a street it's a highway

my 13 year old is still not comfortable

walking to and from the subway without

me

what a sad statement that a 13 year old

is afraid to walk near her school

even worse she's not even close to alone

1.3 million people live in the central

living district that's a lot of people

going about their lives or at least

trying to they are walking to school

going to appointments meeting friends

but everywhere they go the onslaught of

impatient drivers spewing their

poisonous fumes degrades their living

experience

and living and driving in the zone

doesn't make your car any less of a

problem

think twice or even three times before

choosing to drive into and around

manhattan

just because you don't crash doesn't

mean you aren't inflicting harm

just like secondhand smoke got banned in

office buildings we need people to

recognize their negative externalities

and adjust their behaviors

your choice to drive affects millions of

new yorkers who just want to live their

lives

i strongly support congestion pricing

because i think kids deserve to walk to

school in peace

not in fear

let's get more drivers to make the right

choice to get out of their cars and join

us on foot on bikes and in our transit

system thank you so much

===

hello

hello we can hear you okay great uh my

name is jonathan miller

um

i am a lifelong and fifth generation i'm

a lifelong resident of the lower east

side i'm also fifth generation lower

east side i would like to note that this

is not

the central business district as has

been referred to in this call um it is

home to roughly one million people

um this plan will undoubtedly result in

higher costs of living for those people

regardless of home but regardless of car

ownership

i'd like to note that my taxes pay for

these roads i should be able to drive

them without paying anything additional

we mentioned disabilities i mentioned

but what about people what about people

who have children i use my car to take

my children to the doctor to obtain

special services for one of my children

has a hearing loss this is not a car to

head to my vacation home this is not a

car to head to the airport i am a

working class father for the first of a

family of five

public transportation on the lower east

side is an absolute mess i can't take my

kids to the east broadway station

because it is the 12th most dangerous

stop in the city the m14 is among the

worst bus lines in manhattan and school

busing is chronically late i cannot bike

to school with three kids under six

i believe the goals of this plan are

noble but

residents of this district and the under

60th street need an exemption anything

else would be an insult to these

residents who already pay ex absorbently

to call this place home

please please please grant an exemption

for residents of this district thank you

thank you

===

hi i'm sarah lind i live on the upper

west side but for almost every job i've

had in new york i've had to commute into

the central business district

my primary mode of transportation is the

subway but i also recently started

biking when there's a safe route

a few years ago i was at work at my

office on east 39th street when i got a

call no parent ever wants my son who has

an incredibly severe nut allergy had

been at the park when another nanny gave

him a snack without asking

he was now struggling to breathe his

lips swelling up vomiting and wheezing

i told my nanny to give him the epi pen

and call 9-1-1 and i told her i would

meet her at the emergency room

reflexively i thought a cab will be

fastest and i grabbed the first one i

saw

it was anything but

we sat stuck in the congestion of

millions of people trying to take cars

around the densest most walkable city in

america

in retrospect a bike likely would have

been fastest but this was back when i

was still terrified to ride a bike on

our chaotic city streets

a bus certainly wouldn't have been any

faster there were no bus lanes then and

even if there were they likely wouldn't

have been enforced

and what if i'd gotten stuck on a train

underground without cell phone service

so a car it was but it was agonizingly

slow

by the time i made it to the emergency

room my son had received an extensive

array of interventions and he was

largely stable

ultimately he was fine but he was

without his mother for one of the most

traumatic moments of his small life and

being stuck in that car was incredibly

terrifying for me

i tell this story to say yes there are

occasions when you really need to be in

a car in the central business district

but the vast majority of trips could use

other modes and congestion pricing would

encourage that and that would free up

the streets so that traffic can move

smoothly for the people who really do

need to be in a car like me in that cab

trying desperately to get to my son who

was facing a life-threatening emergency

we need congestion pricing now thank you

===

oh great okay i actually i'm pretty

active with the community board eight um

and i noted that

our

leader

um

spoke this evening

jeffrey

oh no i don't know i wrote his name down

anyway um i i don't want to go take up

too much time here i'm actually not for

congestion pricing because it's a

regressive tax but i am for building

large um municipal parking lots out in

the outer boroughs in the queens bronx

and brooklyn near the subway top hubs to

allow people in the outer boroughs that

really don't want to drive in to get on

the subways if the you let them park in

the municipal parking lots i know this

is a different idea right and off the

subject but too bad um for a hundred

bucks a month they jump on the subways

you've got the subways packed now you

can yell about the subways are crowded

and you don't have to worry about it

anymore that was number one number two

um which mayor allowed the hundreds of

thousands of ubers and lyfts to come

into the city and i remember when he did

it adding to the traffic jams and then

it just got to be ridiculous right so i

agreed that there's traffic but

you know we we the drivers didn't do it

okay number three

um the central um

business district is is actually not on

60th street 59th street or 57th street

it's way downtown in fact

okay

so so and and the reality of 61st street

is something that you may not know but

it is in constant construction because

the main water gas power and telephone

lines from the area are all on that

street and in that area right there

between 60 61st and on 61st street

they're always closing the street

they're doing construction that will

force all drivers to go down to 60th

street therefore we are begging you

because we know you're going to go

through with this if you go through with

this is to put the line below 60th

street that will allow residents in the

area to go down lex turn right on 60th

and go to park avenue on the east side

of park to park they're about 15 to 17

spots there what

===

uh good evening can you hear me

yes we can all right wonderful so i i

mean being so late in the queue i got to

look up a couple facts uh the edc census

bureau 45 percent of new york city

people own cars so a good number of us

own cars we're all wealthy people those

secondary homes 45 of us own cars

people like to make comparisons to

london

as far as uh

vehicle accidents and deaths

london encompasses twice the number of

square miles in new york city new york

city covers 300 square miles london

covers

600 square miles the death ratio is

comparable as far as pollution levels

air pollution levels

according to the world health

organization london is worse

so as we like to you know put blood in

it on a pedestal and say how it's really

working it's great stuff it's all not

true as far as let's go into secondary

homes because we have a car

uh

that's ridiculous right uh

some of us take our kids to chelsea

piers for

uh hockey

uh for golf because there is no other

areas right and we take them across town

so i think anybody that's in uh

uh mrs glick's uh

uh zone 66 if she's for it they should

be against it every business owner

should say look you're going to hurt us

because we go over to your area

as far as congestion in new york city

why is it up

uh 90 of the office space that is

currently rented people are not going to

work

20

is at unleased that's according to new

york times people are afraid to come in

so they're driving that's a fact

right so let's just those people

not have them come in and see how new

york city does then right new york city

has to get back on its feet

and by penalizing people the residents

and also the people that come into

manhattan

would be a horrible horrible mistake at

some point congestion price it might

make sense

yep right now i think it's just a

terrible terrible idea by a bunch of

people that don't live here

thank you
