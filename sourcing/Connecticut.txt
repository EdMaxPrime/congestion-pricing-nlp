hello there

we can hear you

okay great can you see me

yes

hi good afternoon as you said my name is

johnny king

i live in new haven connecticut and i'm

a motorcyclist who commutes to new york

city for work

i work in all of the five boroughs

because i'm a film television group

and we do many locations

um you'd be correct if you assumed right

now by my opener that i'm speaking today

on behalf of all motorcyclists who will

be affected to implore you to make

motorcyclists exempt from the congestion

tolling that is forthcoming

i own a car

but for the sake of saving gas and easy

parking

and cutting down on my commute time i

opt to ride my motorcycle

actually

now in light of the tolling that will

take place

i'd be even more incentivized to ride my

motorcycle provide provided that

motorcyclists are indeed exempt which i

hope that you guys will make us exempt

um i hope that first of all thank you

for

the cbd tp to allow us to to give these

comments because i think that this is a

monumental uh happening that is going to

affect so much in the future

i hope that you guys consider that going

forward

without exempting motorcyclists that

you'd be setting a new precedent that

would penalize or at least not reward

motorcyclists who who

have proven around the globe

that

congestion and carbon footprinting is

definitely mitigated by riding two

wheels

and now with late model motorcycles that

have catalytic converters the old idea

that motorcycles don't really actually

help with mitigating carbon footprinting

is not true

i hope that you guys will definitely

take in

consideration that we should be exempt

from paying a toll while reducing uh

congestion thank you

===
hi can you hear me

yes we can hi i'm dice i live in

stanford connecticut

as a resident of connecticut who

frequently travels to new york city i'd

like to comment strongly in favor of

congestion pricing

the driving community needs to take more

responsibility for the many negative

externalities that their behavior causes

on the rest of society such as air

pollution and pedestrian deaths

there is no god-given right to drive and

park a motor vehicle for free into the

densest and most transit-rich city in

the united states we are in a climate

crisis and it's imperative that we do

everything to discourage unnecessary

driving and encourage public transit use

congestion pricing is one important

policy tool that should be used to raise

the cost of driving

and use the revenue to fund alternatives

please ignore the naysayers who claim

that it's somehow unjust to raise the

cost of driving

drivers are overwhelmingly wealthy

compared to the vast majority of the

working class who take the bus or train

into new york city who suffer from slow

buses stuck in car traffic from asthma

caused by car tail pipe emissions and

who are killed and injured by reckless

drivers

there should be zero exemptions for

special interests or income groups

congestion pricing will fail if there

are too many carve outs

everyone needs to pay their fair share

for driving

thank you for your time

hi my name is jackie cohen good

afternoon i'm the director of climate

and equity policy at tri-state

transportation campaign an advocacy and

policy organization fighting for

sustainable mobility in connecticut new

york and new jersey

we are in a climate emergency and our

region is faced with the challenge

reducing greenhouse gas emissions 85 and

reaching 100 net zero carbon emission

economy by 2050. since the devastating

impact of superstorm sandy in 2012 we

have been at the front line of the

climate crisis that continues to

threaten the region torrential downpours

and flash flooding from some storm from

storms in recent weeks are expected to

occur more frequently and become even

more severe we must act now to to reduce

carbon emissions from the transportation

sector

not only does congestion pricing protect

our environment and public health by

reducing the number of cars driving into

manhattan it's also a win for millions

of transit riders including thousands of

metro north commuters coming from

connecticut who rely on regional transit

that is in desperate need of new revenue

to fund its multi-billion dollar capital

program

we at tri-state transportation campaign

have been fighting for congestion

pricing for well over a decade and now

it's finally within reach we cannot wait

uh we cannot afford to delay any longer

thank you

===

can you hear me now yes we can okay so

sorry i was having trouble with my uh

zoom hi um i live in west hartford

connecticut um i'll try to speak briefly

i would like i support this program for

multiple reasons one of which from a

connecticut residence standpoint i visit

my son in queens frequently

i love taking my wife and i love taking

rail but

metro north is very very slow we know

that the infrastructure has been

totally neglected over the years i saw

this i see this as one of many possible

sources of funds

to make those improvements

um

i also of course support the what other

uh people were saying about the

environmental benefits

uh my son is a is an avid cyclist and

for that and he

he's also a pedestrian obviously and and

user of transit

and uh

getting more vehicles off the road

is a good way to improve safety uh for

cyclists and also to encourage people to

take transit

i also

support it for the environmental reasons

that

were mentioned

i think this is one of many things that

can be done

to reduce greenhouse gas consumption

emissions and i in fact i hope that

15 to 20 seems like a very low i would

like to see

50 of the vehicular traffic in in

manhattan reduced

and uh in turn we could

it would make the people the essential

services you know the the taxis the

the emergency vehicles the buses etc

would also have an easier time getting

around

so thank you very much

===

hello

we can hear you

hello

um i would like to say that

i'm actually a resident of the

central business district

and um i couldn't join the other meeting

for residents but i would like to say

that i'm very against

congestion pricing

um it would

add

to the cost of living and

i would also say you know a nice

compromise because i know that the mta

needs more money would be to at least

give

exemptions to people who live in the

zone

um people who live in satin island who

live in a rockaway get a discount on the

tolls

in addition the exemption is not based

on income

but

the program it's offering is only people

who make

um 60 000 or below which i'm totally

against because

it's hard to live in this area

and

make only that income

and a few alternatives would be

instead of

having the

um

toll based on the area why not just told

every bridge

that connects to manhattan

bring back the commuter tax

um

and find

just find other ways so it doesn't add

to

um cost of goods to

small businesses who

rely on

bringing their goods into the area

because they will pass down what they

have to pay in tolls to customers

thank you
