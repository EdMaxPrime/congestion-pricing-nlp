okay thank you well thank you to the mta

the city dot state dot and the federal

highway administration for having this

uh

these meetings these public meetings uh

i know we have a short time so many of

the questions i will uh do offline but i

just wanted to

make sure i took part today uh over the

years i've had many concerns and

opposition to congestion pricing as it

relates to the

people of staten island and the

commuters uh going to work from staten

island

and it is my hope that those uh

those concerns will be addressed as this

process goes through and as the mta

decides to go with congestion pricing

the uh stat the issues that i'm

concerned about are that staten

islanders are held harmless when it

comes to double tolling that they are

not double told because of the high toll

on the verrazano bridge and their

commute to work

in manhattan

also that revenue is dedicated to staten

island projects at a certain percentage

of the revenue uh that is

uh

that comes from congestion pricing is

put towards specific projects uh that

are important to staten island's

transportation needs and also to protect

the existing verrazano bridge discount

is very important as you move forward in

this

i hope that you take our considerations

uh to heart uh also i would suggest that

as you the mta does with with the trains

and buses with a free transfer uh that

is a suggestion i would make to the

board is some sort of transfer uh with a

time limit of about two hours if you

cross one of the outer borough bridges

uh particularly the verrazano bridge

that it doesn't cost you uh going into

the zone uh that

===

i am assembly member david weprin and i

represent the 24th assembly district i

am an advocate for more public transit

funding but this one size fits all

congestion pricing structure

is not the solution

it is an out of borough tax that will

hurt disadvantaged families in new york

city

while we are still

recovering from the covet 19 pandemic

the current congestion pricing plan is

highly manhattan-centric

and completely ignores middle-class

families and small businesses in the

outer boroughs communities in eastern

queens which i represent central

brooklyn and parts of the bronx are

transit deserts people have to take two

buses before they can reach the subway

for many their trip into manhattan can

take two hours taxing working families

who use a car to avoid a long tiring

commute will only add additional

expenses to budgets that are already too

tight this impacts the disabled who

cannot use public transit and the

elderly who need to get to a medical

appointment fast furthermore the mta is

set to receive 10.5 billion dollars in

federal dollars what is the mta going to

be doing with that money the mta has

been notorious for mismanaging funds we

shouldn't have to subsidize these

wasteful practices i would support

modifications to congestion pricing

which would allow those who are

low-income seniors disabled from transit

deserts to receive an exemption or pay a

lower toll there are other ways to

generate revenue such as ending the

stipulated fine program restoring the

commuter tax or increasing fees on app

based for higher vehicles we must focus

on fixing the mta while ensuring it is

not at the expense of working families

in the outer boroughs there is no

exception or tax credit as there is in

the central business directorate for

people in transit desert thank you

===

thank you my name is eric dinowitz new

york city council member for the 11th

district in the bronx

i want to express some concerns about

the central business district tolling

program

we know fewer cars on the roads a good

thing for the for new york city

raising revenue to improve our aging

subway infrastructure and inefficient

bus system is of the utmost importance

that said we must ensure that the

revenue raised from this proposal is

disbursed equitably this program must

not become a blank check for improving

the condition of public transportation

in manhattan alone

especially since many of the people

driving into manhattan do so because of

poor transit options where they are

currently the only information we have

shows that roughly 80 percent of the

revenue from the program will benefit

new york city transit no further

breakdown of where those funds will be

used

the plan must include

dedicated funding for each borough

based on factors such as ridership and

need which includes accessibility it's

one of the biggest issues we currently

have with our subway system

accessibility there are too many

stations that do not accommodate people

with disabilities or older adults

only 24 of the stations in new york city

are fully accessible and predictably

the bronx is below that figure

according to a new york city

controller's report 59

of neighborhoods in the bronx do not

have access to ada compliance stations

compared with only 26

in manhattan that has to change

we also have a bus system that does not

fully meet the needs of bronx residents

whether it's to get to and from the

subway travel across the bronx or use

the express bus to get downtown

this only reliable ada compliant mode of

transportation is often shortchanged

resulting in long wait times bunching

and the treatment of bus riders as

second-class commuters again dedicated

funding which will likely be paid by

outer borough residents to making the

entire subway system accessible and

investing in our bus system especially

underserved communities like the bronx

must be paramount

when deciding how to disperse these

monies thank you

===

thank you cbdtp admins for letting me

speak this morning i'm here to voice my

strong support for the cbd towing in

manhattan and energy mta to speed up the

process to implement the program as

quickly as possible too much time has

already been wasted and too much time is

seemingly going to be spent on reaching

out to the public

new york city is choking in car exhaust

our streets are overly congested all day

every day pedestrians and bicyclists are

put in danger every day as they have

become squeezed out while the city does

next to nothing to prevent to limit

private vehicle access use in the

transit-rich towing zone in manhattan

buses get hopelessly stuck in this

congestion and everybody loses the

status quo is not working people from

all over the region city residents and

otherwise drive into the core of

manhattan because there is no incentive

for them not to other than the time lost

due to the time they spent in congestion

that they themselves are helping to

create people avoid transit because

they're somehow able to drive over the

east river bridges and into manhattan

for free and for some reason on sundays

they're allowed to park for free while

transit riders have to pay their fair

share every day of the week all the time

beyond traffic in just in manhattan all

of these drivers have to go through

other communities to get there traffic

in brooklyn in queens is a disaster

right now as people squeeze onto the

bridges to access manhattan just look at

the constant flow of cars off the

brooklyn bridge snaking their way

through brooklyn heights onto the bqe

just to avoid the toll at the battery

tunnel the same at the 59th street

bridge and queensborough posit just to

avoid the midtown tunnel this has to be

controlled if confronted with the

financial incentive to actually take

public transit people will change their

modes of transportation and it will help

make the city more livable for everybody

for those who absolutely must drive into

the central business district area for

some reason their toll will help pay for

better transit for everybody i also urge

the committee to not overburden the

program with exemptions and carve outs

that would water down to the program and

harm it for everybody again i urge the

mta to implement cbd tolling as soon as

possible 16 months is time we just do

not have to waste thank you

===

um 2023

is

far far too long for this project to

wait before being implemented buses are

at a crawl hundreds of thousands of

people rely on our on our

bus system that is absolutely joked in

traffic day in day out every single day

the

actual residents of new york city are

are being forced to sit in car traffic

that uh that they simply can't afford to

uh they simply can't avoid

i think that a 2023 date for the

implementation of this is

beyond too long this uh the central

business district tolling program should

have gone into place

five years ago

three years ago two years ago last year

yesterday

i encourage

everyone involved to get this project

done completed and implemented as soon

as possible i don't think anybody here

who works in

any kind of private capacity would allow

for a 16-month stall before actual

implementation of a necessary

profit earning program thank you

thank you

===

i just want to say i'm disgusted

with this whole thing because new york

city d.o.t new york state d.o.t the mta

they do nothing about all the illegal

government employees parking all over

the city and no standing zones and bus

lanes and don't even get me started

because i met with hank gutman i told

the mayor de blasio i talked to the

staten island dlt people you guys do

nothing about people distracted driving

is the number one cause of accidents for

a decade now okay you're letting people

drive with cell phones mounted on their

windshield they don't even look at the

road they're staring at a cell phone

screen on their windshield okay it's

disgusting okay and now for staten

islanders they close the two lanes going

inbound into brooklyn at the bqe so we

know that the express buses are delayed

getting into manhattan for the evening

rush because they use the ul terry

tunnel okay so why isn't the money going

towards the repairing the bqe at the

triple promenade we're talking millions

of dollars here we've got the best

people in this city and state and we're

just that's what we do on the triple

promenade it's a joke i am disgusted

with the mta with the department of

transportation you people were a day

late and a dollar short thinking about

this okay you could have put the tools

on the east river bridges and been done

with it but now you got to get 28

different counties in the tri-state area

involved you're going to have off-peak

hours peak periods i mean for me i live

in noodle up in staten island i usually

start my day at six or seven a.m in

manhattan if i'm working in manhattan

okay to get to 23rd and 6th avenue for a

six a.m call you know what time i got to

leave my house at three o'clock in the

morning i can guarantee everybody who's

working for the nta has probably never

woken up at three or four o'clock in the

morning for work okay what kind of life

is it if i go to work for 10 hours and

then i'm commuting two hours each way to

get back and forth to work when i can

just drive and save myself two hours

yeah i gotta pay 25 hours for an early

bird parking but guess what that's my

choice i'm not going to be a slave to

mta and just keep giving more money to

you guys it's ridiculous

===

yes okay

good morning my name is mackenzie fillo

i live in brooklyn right next to the

entrance to the brooklyn bridge and i

work in lower manhattan i strongly

support congestion pricing

and urge mta to implement it as soon as

possible

we need to implement congestion pricing

to help mitigate the impact of the

coming climate disaster

most new yorkers don't even have cars

and the government should encourage

those who do to drive less and take the

subway more

congestion pricing will do just that

but even putting complex

climate change aside completely

congestion pricing is still a great idea

that will dramatically improve the lives

of new yorkers

drivers are becoming increasingly

unhinged this is the deadliest year on

our streets in some time

drivers speed and run red lights

causing death injury and disability in

numbers that should shock everyone they

also park on the sidewalk and in the

bike lane and in the bus lane and cars

are noisy they disturb the peace and

they spew fumes that cause asthma and

they clog our streets slowing down

ambulances and fire trucks as they

respond to emergencies

cars make life worse for new yorkers and

everything we can do to reduce driving

will improve life here

moreover if we reduce the number of

people driving into the city we can

repurpose some of the space currently

dedicated to cars and we can have wider

sidewalks and more trees and grass it is

a win-win i urge mta to speed up the

timeline for instituting congestion

pricing and to grant only those

exemptions required by the legislature

every exemption that you grant will

reduce the effectiveness of the program

thank you

===

uh my name is steven scalisi i'm a

licensed professional traffic engineer

um

i have three

things to say and first of all as a

preliminary i'm all for congestion

pricing and it would affect me but i

think time has come

for it to be implemented in our city

first question is and these are mostly

procedural

parking on the queens and brooklyn sides

of the free bridges and above sixtieth

street needs to be included in the

environmental assessment i'm sure it is

but in terms of queens and brooklyn it's

not just the other side of the bridge

it's further inland where people can

park on the street

and hop on the subway

secondly

i'm sure there is a regional model

traffic simulation model that's being

used

i've worked with many firms in the past

it has to be a demand responsive model

not just a

uh stochastic model

that means it's not just being input and

then hit a button and see what the

results are has to be

deterministic to see that traffic is

moving around based on inputs such as

toll prices

third maybe the most important is the

the traffic data collection

um

you know they say garbage in garbage out

when was the traffic input into the

model is it pre-pandemic levels or now

during the pandemic which we all know

traffic volumes are low

so i'd like to make sure that whoever

doing that model

that they account for pre versus during

versus post pandemic to make sure that

the model is as accurate as possible to

assess impacts

uh that's it for now thank you for your

input it was a very fine presentation

thank you

===

hello

uh i'm a born and bred new yorker uh

hailing from the deeper reaches of

queens i've been traveling into the cbd

on a regular basis since middle school

it's where i got my education on my

first job after college

and not once did i ever think it would

be a good idea to travel there by car i

took a bus to a train like most queen's

commuters going to manhattan

the car is a scourge in new york city

new yorkers cannot hear ourselves think

with all the noise cars create we cannot

breathe the air without damaging our

lungs we can't even safely cross the

street because of the threat of the

automobile in our city this leads to a

few questions

why do we allow ourselves

why do we allow such a dangerous and

environmentally harmful instrument to

come into the densest part of our city

without any limits or restrictions why

do we allow drivers to externalize all

of the costs their transportation mode

incurs on everyone while they enjoy all

of the benefits

this isn't a sustainable model for

transportation and the gridlock we're

witnessing manhattan proves it there is

a better way

we can internalize the cost of driving

by charging a fee to enter the cbd

we can put a price on driving so

individuals who engage in this harmful

act have to reconsider whether they

truly need to get in their cars

we can use the money generated by the

program to fund capital projects for the

mta and improve public transportation

for everybody which will make new york a

cleaner more equitable city that will

become a model of transportation justice

for the entire country

i encourage the traffic mobility review

board to enact congestion pricing

swiftly after this environmental

assessment is completed i encourage them

to not create any exemptions beyond

those defined in the mta reform and

traffic mobility act i encourage the

governor to override any attempts to

water down this first indonesian program

i look forward to a day when new york

city is once again

able to deliver on its promise a better

life for all thank you

===

thank you thank

you for this opportunity to speak my

name is philip i'm a lifelong resident

of the bronx

i'm here to express my concern about the

possible implementation of congestion

pricing which i believe unfairly affects

the residents of the well less wealthy

outer boroughs like millions of new york

city residents i take the subway to work

to manhattan every day and understand

the need to find funding for the mta to

ensure that this critical function is

able to operate however i have concerns

about this proposal because i believe it

ultimately makes outer borough residents

pay for subway repair while not

addressing the actual reason for the

increased congestion in manhattan over

the last decade which have been the

increase of four higher vehicles from

companies such as uber and lyft in fact

the 2019 quinnipiac poll showed that a

vast majority of new york city residents

especially in the bronx are against

congestion pricing

due to its manhattan

centric nature

so let me talk about some of these

concerns like i said reducing for hire

vehicles should be the primary focus of

any attempts to quote decongest the

central business district instead of

asking the outer boroughs to pay

we all know that companies like uber

have actively lobbied for congestion

pricing which indicates that they stand

to benefit from this

you know

as far as the environmental aspect look

i've battled for against pipelines for

the green you deal this is a small

band-aid in that quest so but however if

there is an environmental aspect to it

there should be an exemption for hybrid

and electric vehicles finally

my biggest concern is how do we know

that places like the bronx will get the

fair benefits of this when it happens

and that the funds will not just go to

places like the hudson yards

or expanding the second avenue subway

into newly gentrified areas

right remember this scheme was pedaled

to us through the move ny plan which

called for reductions in bridge and

outer borough tolls to compensate for

this manhattan-centric nature

you know as a resident of new york city

i hope this never passes there are a

better way to fund the mta let's tax the

rich let's do something else but let's

not do it off the backs of people from

the bronx thank you

===

good morning and thank you for giving me

the time to talk like the person before

me i'm also a bronx resident that

commutes into new york city every day

um via train and so i also feel as

though that the congestion pricing would

represent an unfair burden to one of the

poorest counties in the city

and one of the poorest counties in the

country

what we find is with the mta

particularly if you live in the bronx

that the trains aren't reliable weekend

service is often not operational daytime

service particularly on the 2 train

which project

has been

going on for at least 10 or 15 years is

non-existent and so sometimes driving is

the only way to do that i don't think

this panel has looked at

what has created the congestion which is

the increased number of uber lyft and

other

taxis and tlc vehicles

as well as the introduction of buses and

bike lanes and so i think while a study

has not been done to see how that has

impacted the congestion

downtown that we are then asking the

residents and the poorest residents of

the city to then

shoulder the burden

additionally if there are plans as there

was mentioned before to have tolls on

the bridges and tunnels or the bridges

coming in from the bronx into the city

again i think it represents an unfair

way of generating money for what has

been notoriously one of the most

inefficient agencies in the city

um i think like the person before me

mentioned there are other ways to look

at how to reduce congestion and there

are other ways to make some of these tlc

uber lyft type of places or type of

companies bear some of this

responsibility instead of being the most

vocal advocates for congestion pricing

and which then you really have to look

at the irony of that

again i think it is the unfair burden on

the outer boroughs

ah thank you i just want to say i think

it's an unfair burden to people in the

outer boroughs who have very limited

ways of getting downtown throughout

various days of the week

===

yes hi

i'm not seeing uh

okay there we go

my name is phil konigsberg

and i live in northeast queens

for the past 14 years i've opposed any

attempt to implement a congestion

pricing toll program

every time a new plan arises from the

grave

because it unfairly targets motorists

from the outer boroughs who must travel

into the center city

i am once again testifying against the

latest effort this morning

there are a multitude of outer borough

residents who are physically unable to

ride mass transit

and their only mode of transportation

into manhattan is via a private vehicle

the new york city d.o.t issues a parking

placard to persons with severe permanent

disabilities

allowing them to park in otherwise

restricted areas

i'm glad to see that there's indication

that

exemptions will be made for them

for these individuals but i would like

to know further details

when there are numerous medical

facilities available in the while there

are numerous medical facilities

available in the outer boroughs the

major hospitals remain concentrated in

manhattan

and add an additional surcharge

on top of existing bridge and tunnel

tolls and parking costs

is an unreasonable hardship

for any new yorker

who is unable to use mass transit and

has to enter the center city

to obtain medical care

a better plan is to cut down on the four

high higher drivers the uber and the

lifts

use the nypd and the dot

traffic enforcements units to enforce

the illegal double parking and blocking

of priority bus lanes

and develop a plan

to restrict all commercial deliveries to

late night and early mornings i also

think a good way is to

reinstate the commuter tax thank you

===

good morning

i'm patrick harrell and i live in

brooklyn

um and i'm speaking in support of this

idea

like many other americans i grew up in a

really polluted area and as a child i

developed asthma um

it was debilitating as a child

uh one year i missed 25 days of school

because of the asthma attacks

persistent you know illnesses from

that asthma and this dynamic plays out

thousands of times across the country

and it is a choice it's a choice that we

continue to allow our air to be polluted

not every kid that misses 25 days to

school doesn't get left behind and there

are so many people that

you know

drop out of school basically because of

health issues

studies have shown time after time that

there's a very clear link between

educational attainment and pollution in

the area

basically because of asthma illnesses as

well as some sort of less understood

impacts on

on childhood development

as i've returned commuting to manhattan

i have encountered more and more idling

cars as the traffic volume have gone up

both in manhattan and on the bridges

waiting to go into manhattan

and i just would urge the mta to

implement this policy as quickly as

possible

to address this air quality crisis in

the city today

thank you

===

my name is anya i live in brooklyn and i

ride a motorcycle i rely on my

motorcycle to allow me to travel to and

from transit deserts that i wouldn't be

able to affordably access without it it

is my lifeline to the city and it makes

it possible for me to take fewer taxis

and not spend hours upon hours on buses

many folks who live in transit deserts

who can't afford a car rely on

motorcycles and motor scooters to help

them get into the cbd so that they can

work i implore you to give a 100 percent

exemption for motorcycles and motor

scooters from the congestion proposed

congested pricing

encouraging folks to use their cars less

and instead use motorized two-wheeled

vehicles will best serve the stated

goals of the congestion pricing

initiative while not penalizing

vulnerable communities and folks whose

transportation choices are already

serving the best interests of our city

by exempting them from congestion

pricing we will be encouraging the use

of motorized two-wheeled vehicles which

will dramatically reduce air traffic

congestion fuel consumption carbon

dioxide emissions and crowded parking

there are numerous studies that show

that by replacing even a small minority

of cars with motorized two-wheeled

vehicles leads to these benefits sam

schwartz our former nyc traffic

commissioner himself did a study that

showed that if the daytime mix of

vehicles shifted to what 80 percent cars

and only 20 percent motorized

two-wheeled vehicles nyc would see a

reduction in traffic delays of more than

4.6 million hours per year which is

nearly 100 working hours per year per

person it would also lead to a massive

carbon dioxide emission reductions and

millions of gallons of reduced fuel

consumption it adds up to a total

savings for new york city of more than

122 million per year in fuel and labor

productivity there is a very strong

precedent for making these exemptions

nearly every major city in europe has

provided special exemptions for

two-wheeled motor vehicles because they

recognize the incredible value that

their cities gain and reduce

traffic congestion increase transit

equality reduce environmental impact and

fuel consumption reduce wear and tear on

their infrastructure and increase safety

for bicyclists and pedestrians by having

people ride their small light and fuel

efficient two-wheeled motor vehicles a

motorcycle weighs a tiny fraction of

a tiny fraction of what a car weighs

reducing damage to our roads and you can

fit six motorcycles in a single car

parking space it's essential that we

emphasize the greater reliance on public

transit yeah available

===

thank you uh sorry just a moment please

um

i believe that the uh the central uh

business district tolling program as

proposed is inherently flawed that the

the wealthiest people already live in

manhattan below 60th street so this

translates into a tax on the traveling

poor and attacks on the outer boroughs i

think the proposal also includes flawed

evidence on how travel speeds have

decreased for buses

new york city's vision zero effort is

largely responsible for slowing buses

it's focused on a wholesale slowing of

vehicles without studying any side

effects including bus routes on those

streets

but understanding the studies already

underway my specific suggestions include

that the study

study impacts on neighborhoods near the

boundary on the opposite side of

manhattan near bridges in addition to

the tunnels mentioned in the

presentation

that the toll amount should be lower for

the occasional use and raised to be

higher with more frequent use which

aligns with the study's goal to reduce

vehicle congestion in the area

and most importantly that the toll

applied to all vehicles from city

agencies and to those with city placards

many of the vehicles coming into the

central business district are employees

of the courts and the agency

headquarters there already enjoying free

parking so this is an equity issue do

not allow a privileged municipal class

to make the rules for others while

giving themselves a workaround even the

governor the mayor and city council

members should pay the toll if they

drive into the area

thank you

===

yes can you hear me

yes we can

all right my name is sheila shapiro and

i am a member of the forest hills green

team which is a local environmental

group in queens

new york city needs to embrace

congestion pricing

charging fees on vehicles driving into

or within manhattan central business

district is projected to raise over a

billion dollars a year for mass transit

in new york city while helping weekday

traffic in manhattan move faster

expensive upgrades are essential for our

subway and bus systems which are already

underfunded and in crisis

recent u n reports warn we have less

than 12 years to avoid the worst climate

crisis scenarios because congestion

pricing will lower carbon emissions by

shifting more trips from vehicles to

mass transit it is an essential part of

new york's response according to a

community service society study

only four percent of outer borough

residents drive to manhattan for work

congestion pricing is considered the

single biggest contributor of

predictable sustainable revenue

for this purpose

these fees can be required to be used

only for mass transit improvements

at the same time the mta needs to be

reformed and closely monitored thank you

===

hi good morning thanks for this

presentation today i'm here to voice my

emphatic support for congestion pricing

i live in brooklyn i go to school and i

work in downtown brooklyn and

the cbd area

i'm an asthmatic and my asthma is

triggered by air pollution

vehicle tailpipe emissions are a major

part contributor to air pollution in new

york city

and for that we need congestion pricing

in here

there is a legitimate concern that

congestion pricing does not solve the

pollution problem but i would just point

out that other cities around the world

have done this

london implemented congestion pricing in

2003 their air pollution has gone down

their vehicle travel speeds have gone up

and it's become a more sustainable safer

city for everybody involved

uh

furthermore i do agree with the

panelists who pointed out that there

should be a motorcycle exemption or at

least a motorcycle reduction in toll

rates

uh

well also i would want to point out that

um

that ride share should not get a one ta

a once a day toll it should be charged

per trip

but uh i want to advocate this because

uh we need to disincentivize ride share

ubers had increased congestion by 30 percent

in manhattan uh over it uh since its

inception

uh furthermore i would want to point out

that car most new yorkers do not have

access to a car 54 percent of new yorkers don't

have access to a car

new yorkers who have access to a car uh

in general earn 44000

more than non-car owners in new york

city car owners are a lot richer than

non-car owners in new york city car

owners are minority congestion pricing is

the way to go we need better investment

in our transit we need to eliminate our

transit deserts we need better buses we

need better trains we need more

accessible trains and for that

congestion pricing now thank you

===

alright so

would i uh disagree with is that the

insinuation right is that drivers are

the problem that drivers are creating an

externality

that they're not paying for the price

they pay to go in the city right but the

intent is to force people out of driving

and divert that money to the mta and the

logic behind this is that this will

force car drivers to take the subway

but before covid the ridership levels

were spiking right they doubled in 2014

and multiple lines were over capacity

since 2007. it's not like they increased

fair even to solve the problems right

i mean the mta was in a state of

emergency then too

so if we're going to pretend that you

know there's too many people driving

cars then logically increasing amount of

riders would increase the amount of

fares and this should solve the problem

but it didn't because drivers aren't the

problem for them to use problems

whereas the city and state levels for

decades

took funding out i mean 16 of the mta's

budget goes to paying off the exploded

of high interest loans that new york

state forced the mta to take i mean of

the remaining budget

how much money do we spend on stuff like

the hudson yards renovation that cost

1.4 billion dollars

and then of the remaining funding that

we have that's used for real projects

that will increase the mta's response

time like the renovation of the signal

systems

we pay the highest prices in the world

for that so for the lirr east access

project project we paid seven times the

average worldwide price for a track

mile

for the east for the the second avenue

line we paid five times the average per

track cost for for for the track mile

and then

the logic behind this is that

we're gonna fix that with the new money

i mean where'd the money go we had the

money where'd it go so i don't

understand how this is gonna fix any of

the problems because we've wasted the

money already that's all thank you

===

hi there my name is charlie raffanello

i'm a resident of queens new york um i

appreciate you guys giving us the

opportunity to speak today

it seems to me

congestion pricing is an inevitable

thing in our future um there's one

exemption i want to speak about and i

believe that is motorcycles our vehicles

demonstrably reduce congestion in this

city just as bicycles e-bikes and

scooters do the city has invested a lot

of time and energy

in making those uh means of

transportation more accessible for

people i believe we should be included

in that as well the difference between

e-bikes and scooters and motorcycles is

that we are licensed and insured and

therefore we are accountable for our

actions on the road

our vehicles are also very fuel

efficient we're trying to build a green

city we're trying to take care of our

future

my sv650 makes about 50 miles to the

gallon i've seen it go as high as 58

miles to the gallon

our vehicles are also lightweight and

reduce wear and tear on the road

therefore saving the city money and

saving on greenhouse emissions because

they're not going to require as much uh

construction equipment to fix the roads

after we're done

we also take a minimal amount of parking

spaces you could fit about six

motorcycles where average car or suv

would fit

and finally if you look at what other

cities and municipalities have

implemented congestion pricing have done

they all have given motorcycles

exemption and i believe that in new york

city we deserve the same thing thank you

very much for your time

===

so i'm going to echo some of the

some of the points that a few of the

other speakers have made

my name is gil i live in

brooklyn and i am a motorcycle rider and

i want to

advocate for

a 100 percent exemption for motorcycles um

several uh major cities around the world

have done this with huge success it's

been a it's been you know crucial to

them to these other cities to reduce

congestion and to alleviate problems um

motorcycles are

you know we're a solution to the problem

we are lightweight we take up very

little space we reduce wear and tear on

the roads

we also take up a fraction of parking

that cars and trucks do even though we

pay the same amount for parking

on city streets and most importantly

motorcycles are are extremely fuel

efficient and they're part of the

solution for combating climate change

uh the motorcycle that i usually commute

with gets almost 70 miles to the gallon

um

which is significant um

yeah so i once again i advocate for a

100 percent exemption from the toll for

motorcycles and

i would also like to request more

dedicated motorcycle parking in the city

to encourage more riders more licensed

and trained riders to uh to take up

motorcycle riding thank you

thank you

===

hi i'm joseph and i just want to say

that congestion pricing no good this

plane will affect 700000 people it's

like that's like half that's like almost

a million people not to mention the

outer borough commuters who might be in

fact impacted based on the conditions

this charge will bring on top of that

your agency already charges drivers

money who you take from bridges and

tunnels like the verrazano bridge the

hugh l carry and queen's midtown

traffic on the i-278 is already stressed

with the deteriorating bqe as

drivers going farther northbound

manhattan will use this route to avoid

the toll we don't need more traffic on

the main expressway that supplies new

york city with essentials like food and

medicine deliveries we don't need trucks

we need to make deliveries into

manhattan's core to be charged extra

money who will they pass that charge on

it'll they'll pass it on to us the

average working person new jersey

drivers staten islanders will suffer big

prompting those work working five days a

week to lose up to six thousand dollars

in income this is pocket change to the

rich but a big change for people working

in the office or just as a low-key

restaurant server i'm from brooklyn

every time you air ads saying take the

train i feel like laughing i live in the

depths of brooklyn there is no subway

nobody cares about our neighborhoods

even cycling can compete with transit at

30 percent faster speeds for my commute

at 16 and just riding an e-bike

currently i'm convinced that public

transportation is a no-no for me

i'm not going to spend extra money just

hauling on public train

freezing at bus stops or waiting in

outdoor platforms with no heat

nor will i sit on the queensborough

bridge forever simply because my family

can't afford the surcharge

also it's not congestion pricing if

these tools are in effect 24 7 at like

2am in the morning

like seriously stop ripping off the

middle class save new york city thank

you for listening

===

good morning i wholeheartedly support

the expedited implementation of

congestion pricing i want to tell you

about my commute from brooklyn into our

office at 377 broadway in the central

business district let me walk you

through how drivers choices impact me

and everyone else that uses the canal

street subway station

and remember as i leave the station i

start commuting in our city's most used

mode by foot

from the steps of the subway exit i can

hear the horns blaring my blood pressure

spikes immediately reaching the sidewalk

i take off my mask and take a deep

breath of exhaust fumes the first thing

i see when i get out of the subway

drivers darting through yellow lights

stacking up in the crosswalk

gridlock ensues and pedestrians like me

are forced to weave our way through

impatient drivers i make eye contact to

ensure i'm not hit by a driver as they

try to crawl through to gain that one

extra inch

i intentionally choose to walk downtown

away from canal street to avoid as much

of the chaos as possible but with every

change of the light drivers race forward

to win that one extra second

it puts cyclists and pedestrians in

harm's way as i walk down broadway i

pass a ghost bike a memorial marking

where a driver has hit and killed a

cyclist

i watch working cyclists hurrying to

their next delivery and i fear for them

so every step between my subway and my

office a nightmare because of the

congestion caused by drivers

it doesn't have to be this way we can

have and deserve to have safer less

congested and more efficient city

streets we need congestion pricing asap

i ask that we pass congestion pricing to

ensure all new yorkers can safely use

our streets and my nightmare walk can be

turned into a beautiful new york stroll

thank you

===

there we go hello can you hear me we can

very good my name is phil bader i'm a

member of disabled in action i'm a

person with a disability who depends on

his car to get around the city the

subways are not an option for me and

there is no bus service between brooklyn

where i live and manhattan

i believe that this

central district district tolling

program needs to have accommodations for

people with disabilities who depend on

their cars

i'm not a monster who uses his car

improperly and i'm not rich i believe

there should be some kind of

accommodations for people with

disabilities who drive

thank you

===

yes hello can you hear me we can

thank you

i'm jean ryan i'm president of disabled

in action of metropolitan new york

i live in bay ridge brooklyn

but we have many members in all

boroughs

we are the largest minority

um

disabled in action supports congestion

pricing to reduce traffic reduce

pollution and to raise a great deal of

money to improve and expand public

transit we hope that once the subway

system has elevators kept in good

condition in every station

some of our reliance on access a ride will

be able to be reduced or maybe even

eliminated as far as exemptions we

support exempting taxis access ride

vehicles and for hire vehicles that

are used for excess ride use

already for hire vehicle drivers do

not want to pay tolls and we are afraid

the drivers will refuse to take us to

manhattan or pick us up in manhattan

some people will want even more

exemptions but that will defeat the

purpose of congestion practicing

thank you very much

===

good morning can you hear me we can

okay good morning thank you for giving

me the opportunity to speak yes my name

is harold moskowitz i live

in queens i work

in midtown manhattan i own a business on

first avenue between 54th and 55th

street i am strongly against congestion

pricing

strongly against it i am a serviceman

i'm also a motorcyclist for those of you

who are listening i cannot do the

service calls on the motorcycle it is

not

possible i need 60 pounds worth of tools

to do service calls

plus material i employ four people once

again you are making me the enemy you

made me the enemy with the bike lanes

you made me the enemy with the bus lanes

you're making me the enemy again

with congestion pricing when your

plumbing breaks in midtown who's going

to fix it when the walls leak who's

going to fix it when you need flooring

who's going to do it the man who went on

before me and said all these prices are

going to get passed down to you brother

you're right

every single penny of this is going to

get passed down to the consumer how are

you going to get food onto that island

it's coming on 18 wheelers that's the

only way

now i hear all about

exemptions the bikers want exemptions

very good okay what about me do i get an

exemption no i don't i'm still the enemy

you still want me to pay

once again you have made me the enemy

you want to know what's going to happen

people are going to close up they're

going to leave manhattan

it is going to become a ghost town no

one will want to go there and

incidentally the ubers and the lyft they

get a pass don't they they get a pass

but i have to pay

why

why am i the enemy

why

thank you

===

hi i'm caitlin pearce um i'm here today

to testify on behalf of rider's alliance

to urge the governor and the mta to

implement congestion pricing as quickly

as possible

it's been two years since new york city

riders won a congestion pricing program

in new york and we cannot afford to wait

any longer to implement it

each year that this plan is delayed

transit riders are losing out on at

least a billion dollars in absolutely

critical

improvements for a more reliable and a

more accessible service uh this is at a

time when the mta is already facing a

multi-billion dollar budget gap that

it's going to need to fill to be able to

operate at full capacity

what we need at this moment is a transit

system that our working and middle class

new yorkers in all boroughs can depend

upon to take them to work and to get

them home to their families on time

what riders are experiencing today

daily

subway delays caused by ancient signal

technology in an outdated system

according to mta's own data on time

performance ranks near the bottom of

major transit systems in the developed

world

riders who depend on elevators face the

subway system that is near impossible to

navigate with few accessible stations

and elevators that are almost

way too frequently out of service

and riders experience buses that are

unreliable and maddeningly slow stuck

behind gridlock traffic

congestion pricing will deliver

overwhelmingly positive environmental

impacts by reducing car congestion by

clearing the air of excessive vehicle

exhaust

by raising funds that will be invested

in delivering cleaner transportation for

millions of new yorkers

and it's a progressive means as noted in

the mta's own presentation of raising

revenue from those who can afford the

cost of car ownership and traveling into

the city by car

we call we call upon the governor and

the mta to do everything in their power

to implement congestion pricing quickly

and fairly today thank you very much

===

good morning i'm a lifelong resident of

a double fare zone in queens county a

retired 33-year new york city public

school teacher and avid bicycle rider

and i often take public transportation

but i've also been an active driver in

our city for over four decades i urge

our decision makers to consider new york

city taxpayers who rely on their

vehicles

we should not be double taxed to travel

in our own city whether to work to

frequent shows theaters museums parks

restaurants or any other economic or

cultural generator if congestion pricing

is to be implemented new york city

residents need to be exempted or reduced

during business hours and deserve and

need free access to our city in the

evenings and weekends

businesses and cultural institutions

rely on clientele from outside manhattan

to support their establishments people

regardless of where they live should be

able to access our city after peak hours

and weekends to frequent and support

them consider a family of four from

eastern queens thinking of going to

battery park for a sunday picnic

followed by a trip to a museum the cost

would be over 50 or more and the extra

time commuting would add several hours

to what should be a simple family outing

for most people that would just dissuade

them from ever going to our city as a

child my dad put us to work at a family

restaurant in the upper east side i grew

up in our city's museums and would later

take those sunday trips with my own

family when i became an art teacher in

this great city it was sad when i worked

with students in brooklyn and queens to

find out that many never had been to

manhattan until i took him there on

field trips

families in the outer borders deserve

the right to enjoy and share our city's

parks and cultural institutions in

closing our taxes paid for the right to

use and travel within our city with

undue restriction the dollars we spend

on maintenance drivers spend on

maintenance insurance tolls gas attacks

it provides contributes greatly to our

city's economy and infrastructure

restricting manhattan from those of us

who live in the outer boroughs with

further taxation especially during

non-congestion hours and weekends is

elitist immoral and just plain wrong we

cannot further wall off the island of

manhattan only for the rich

who can afford to live or travel there i

urge the mta to grant fair consideration

to the outer borough taxpayers and

citizens of this great cities thank you

===

hi i'm raymond and i strongly believe

that congestion pricing is an important

tool to achieve a more equitable

sustainable and people-centric city it

is imperative to reduce the amount of

cars within new york city which creates

a whole host of new and exciting ways to

use the space formally taken up by cars

while helping fund our public

transportation congestion pricing is

more reflective of the real cost of

driving in the city both in terms of

land costs the land that physic the road

physically sits on as well as the

negative effects that they have in the

environment and people of new york city

with congestion pricing we we can open

up the space on our roads freeing up um

sorry freeing up space for more active

transportation and creating

um much more reliable public

transportation for faster buses to

raising the funds necessary for subway

modernization we cannot as a result give

rebates to those entering the central

business districts that are not an

emergency vehicle someone who lives

within the congestion zone or an e-bike

or motorcyclist and yes this includes

those from new jersey even with its 12

to 18 dollar tolls on the

hudson river because

the

because even with that toll there is

currently a massive bottleneck going to

and from new jersey on the tunnels and

bridges

such as the holland tunnel resulting in

various delays to mta buses

and other modes of transit

one example is the m21 bus which

frequently is over delayed and has been

cancelled every single day this month

for the mta this is a really good way to

modernize a system and to create a

system that is meant for all new yorkers

this is why congestion pricing is

critical for the sustained

future of public transportation and the

economy as a whole in new york thank you

thank you

===

sarah hello can you hear me okay

hi my name is sarah i live in brooklyn

and i am here today to voice my strong

support of implementing congestion

pricing in new york city as quickly as

possible

i used to take the train everywhere but

in the couple months into the pandemic i

got a car

because i had injured my knee which made

climbing the stairs at my local station

too painful and there isn't a train

station with a reliable working elevator

near my home

i miss taking the train it used to be

the easiest and fastest way for me to

get around the city

and i want to start riding again

but a few things are stopping me

train service is infrequent and

unreliable and i still have problems

with the stairs

to make the subway efficient reliable

and accessible the mta needs money

congestion pricing will give the mta an

ongoing source of revenue that it

desperately needs to build and maintain

subway station elevators and modern

system

a reliable transit system also benefits

my community by decreasing car

congestion in the street and air

pollution in our neighborhoods it will

also make it easier for me on the

occasions that i need to drive into the

city for a doctor's appointment as i

won't be in the gridlocked traffic of

the past few months

i am happy to contribute my part

whenever i drive into manhattan

paying that fee will benefit me in the

long run and it will also benefit my

neighbors and all new yorkers so please

take my money

thank you

===

good morning everyone thank you so much

for hearing my testimony today uh my

name is lola and i'm a resident of

bed-stuy brooklyn i moved here just a

few months ago but i have lived near the

jmz line for over five years

i have been working the bronx for the

past six months commuting every day by

subway and i have spent nearly 18 hours

on the train every week i'm here today

to avoid my strong support of

implementing a robust congestion pricing

program in new york city as quickly as

possible

our subway infrastructure is crumbling

and there were days that i had to take

six trains to get to work and i faced

significant weights every time i had to

transfer

during the pandemic it has been even

more difficult to commute and as a

recovery we need congestion pricing more

than average to speed up buses and

emergency vehicles and make public

transit as convenient as attractive as

possible

congestion pricing would raise at least

15 billion

to fix and modernize the subway which

could update the silence system that is

based on 1930s technology and also

decreased train delays or changing

routes i would also like to mention the

bizarre and tragic scenes in the subway

during the last thunderstorms and

hurricanes this summer which makes me

very nervous to take uh to have to take

the train tonight during the rain and

it's unacceptable for new yorkers to

have to risk their lives in flooded

stations as new york faces

more extreme weather than ever before we

need to upgrade our subway system to be

safer during these events

in addition to raising money

to improve the stations production

pricing would also have a positive

environment effect by clearing the air

and investing in cleaner transportation

for millions of people

thank you for your time

===

thank you thank you hearing my comment

i speak to you as a car owner a cyclist

a pedestrian and a strap hanger and i

speak to you as an outer borough

resident i support the institution of

congestion pricing but i also urge you

to improve the means by which it is

implemented quite simply we need to ask

ourselves how a properly functioning

city should be organized a city

dependent on inefficient polluting

expensive and dangerous private vehicles

to transport its population is not

functioning properly many others have

already spoken about the benefits of

congestion pricing and getting vehicles

off the road so i will only offer this

one perspective which i believe is

different from what has already been

stated

there are times when using a private car

to travel is warranted unfortunately as

a driver the level of congestion that

concurrently afflicts the city deeply

empowers the usefulness of driving

recognizing that there are times when

car travel makes sense we should be

taking measures that improve the

efficiency of driving when it cannot be

avoided when i need to drive into

manhattan i would gladly pay if it meant

the roads would be clear

i urge you all to work to better tailor

this system not only to reduce peak time

congestion but to consider further

measures to reduce private vehicle

traffic especially by addressing traffic

that does not cross into the cbd

instead of a border-centric system like

the one proposed we should be exploring

systems that take cars off of the road

in the outer berms as well

no area of this city that is well served

by public transit should be free to

drive

the citizens of manhattan are not the

only ones who deserve to enjoy reduced

congestion thank you

===

hi thanks for having me uh my name is

laura shepherd i'm a lifelong beans

resident and i'm here to emphatically

support implementing congestion pricing

now we shouldn't have to wait 16 months

to address the obvious persistent

unacceptable undignified conditions

those of us who walk bike and ride

transit put up with every day the

majority of new york city's city

residents do not own cars but our health

safety and quality of life suffers

greatly thanks to the minority who drive

here traffic violence is increasing our

air quality is poor and our buses are

slow and unreliable drivers also

disproportionately contribute to the

climate crisis and we cannot afford to

delay action i currently live in

woodside queens where i primarily rely

on my bike to get around cycling is

convenient affordable and healthy but it

needs to be safer too many cyclists are

injured and killed by drivers and too

many people are deterred from cycling

because of the danger and lack of a

connected protected bike network

throughout the city we need to reclaim

space that is currently inefficiently

occupied by drivers to build this

network i've been doored in the cbd

harassed and threatened by drivers and

frequently encountered drivers blocking

and encroaching on routes designated for

safe bike travel walking in the cbd is

also stressful and miserable due to

vehicle congestion blocked sidewalks and

crosswalks too many mid-block driveways

honking and fumes our transit system

desperately needs upgrades increased

capacity and full accessibility we need

to raise the money to expand the subways

throughout eastern queens as was planned

in 1938 build in phil long island

railroad stations and adopt permanent

city ticket pricing to aid the people

with some of the longest and most

arduous commutes in the city i know this

well because i grew up in oakland

gardens in eastern queens when we lost

the q75 bus to the mta service cuts of

2010 the length of my walks to other bus

routes doubled that same summer i had a

major medical operation at a manhattan

hospital eight days later i was

discharged during rush hour i am still

traumatized by the nearly two hours i

had to spend in traffic on the lie to

get home i would have paid a hundred

dollars that day to get the vehicles of

the able drivers who have alternatives

out of the way

i've relied on express buses trains and

buses to get to follow-up appointments

and procedures for the last 11 years i

cannot drive because i don't have full

range of motion in my right foot and

relying on cabs or for hire vehicles is

prohibitively expensive people with

disabilities are not a monolith and need

a range of options and accommodate which

every uber driver on the road negatively

impacts the majority of us they also

delay emergency vehicles and truck

deliveries please do not grant

additional exemptions which will water

down the tolling program and don't wait

16 months to make our city work for us

===

all right

yes my audio is working

yes sir

all right uh good uh good morning

everybody my name is john de luper i'm

from brooklyn i'm

speaking in support of the new tolling

program

uh hurricane ida showed us a lot of

infrastructure problems in our subways

and for increased resiliency we need new

sources of funds to allow the mta to

modernize its infrastructure and expand

its services

when i'm in manhattan in the central

business district i always try to take

mass transit and i've only taken cars

when absolutely necessary because cars

are so choked by the volume of traffic

we need to get solutions to traffic like

this program implemented immediately

also i want to add that uh just before

the pandemic i had an experience where i

had a business meeting in the city uh

from four to six pm right in the height

of rush hour and despite being on the

ninth floor the constant horn honking

was incredibly frustrating and made our

meeting very hard to conduct

so in terms of noise is a quality of

life issue that congestion pricing could

help address i i think that that is

definitely something we need and we need

to be trying so uh we need to be doing

something about the traffic in the

central business district congestion

pricing has worked in pure cities like

london for nearly 20 years so i'm hoping

we can get this going as soon as

possible so people who do need to drive

to the cbd are not stuck behind those

who aren't and new york

quality of life uh isn't being

deteriorated by car congestion thank you

===

all right can everyone hear me is this

working

yes we can okay great thanks um

thank you so much for holding this event

and inviting us to speak my name is

jordan fraud and i'm a brooklyn resident

um

i get around the city by pretty much

every

means of transit you can imagine i'm a

frequent subway rider i walk i ride my

bike uh my wife and i own a car that we

use occasionally

um and i am a strong supporter of

congestion pricing i

you know have been waiting for this

moment for more than a decade i was

disappointed when congestion pricing

failed in 2008 um and want to strongly

encourage you to move forward with this

process as quickly as possible

um

what we have right now in new york city

is a transit system that does not work

for every for anyone really we have a

subway system that is held together by

duct tape

um and is going to get worse because of

extreme weather it's not accessible to

people with disabilities

we have streets that are dangerous for

pedestrians and cyclists and are

becoming even more so since the pandemic

and if you're a driver you basically are

just sitting in traffic forever

miserable and frustrated uh what

congestion pricing can do is take this

system that does not work for anybody

and change the incentives so that

everyone gets a little bit something

right transit riders get more funds so

that the systems are more accessible

uh pedestrians and cyclists get more

street space that uh you know used by

the you know more street space caused by

fewer cars on the road so that we can

build more infrastructure for them and

drivers get a smoother and faster ride

um

it's basically a win-win for everyone uh

there's evidence from every city that

has ever tried it that it works really

well i just want to strongly encourage

you to not provide exemptions for the

personal vehicles of nypd police or

other city or state employees people

with parking placards on their

professional on their personal cars

should not be exempt from a congestion

pricing charge thanks very much

===

good morning i'm sherry diamond the

district director for congresswoman

nicole malliotakas

representing staten island and southern

brooklyn communities that are both

extremely sensitive to tolling

congresswoman malliotakis introduced h.r.

3715

the protection against double tolling

act legislation that would require the

mta to give the individuals who must pay

an existing toll to connect to the rest

of the city in which they live as staten

islanders must do a credit towards any

congestion pricing fee should new york

city move forward with its planned

congestion pricing program

congresswoman malliotakis has stated

that congestion pricing may have a

number of unintended consequences on new

york city residents commuters and

working class americans especially

during this period of economic recovery

at a time when americans are

experiencing inflation labor shortages

higher energy costs and costlier

consumer goods the last thing the mayor

and the governor should be doing is

implementing more taxation

congresswoman malia takas's

would ensure that residents of staten

island who already pay a toll to connect

to the rest of the city will have that

amount credited from the congestion fee

to prevent them from being double-headed

congresswoman malliotakis's goal is to

slow this program down or perhaps even

stop it altogether but if the congestion

pricing program does get final approval

i will again say that at a minimum the

congresswoman wants protections in place

for the residents of staten island to

ensure that they are never double tolled

thank you

==

um good morning thank you for the

opportunity to testify today in support

of implementing congestion pricing i am

danielle brecker i live in the dutch

kills neighborhood that bridges long

island city and astoria in queens the

seven nwre

are all nearby but yet my neighbors and

i are often delayed late for work school

doctor appointments job interviews

social events and more costing us all

time and money

the delays are almost always a result of

rain or other climate conditions or

malfunctioning signals the signals that

control our subway are based on 1930s

technology and cause train delays on

most days everyone who takes the subway

has been affected by signal delays

countless times our subway system needs

to be much more resilient to climate

change ida was a strong storm i've never

seen rain that heavy or that fast not

even during sandy but while ida may have

been one of the strongest storms it is

far from the first storm to flood

overwhelm and shutter our subway

it must be the last we need congestion

pricing and we need it now it will raise

at least 15 billion dollars to fix and

modernize our subway this will help fund

the mta's fast forward plan to make the

subway reliable and accessible the plan

includes upgrades to modernize the

signal system make more than 50 stations

accessible and deliver critical

improvements to our station completely

cars congestion pricing will have an

overwhelmingly positive environmental

impact by clearing the air of vehicle

exhaust and investing in cleaner

transportation our subway has always

been integral to our city and now it is

integral to our recovery combating

climate the climate crisis and our

future congestion pricing is integral to

keeping our subway moving thank you

my name is tiffany ann taylor and i'm

the vice president for transportation

for the regional plan association a

nearly 100 year old civic organization

working toward better mobility economic

opportunity affordable housing and a

more resilient new york city

metropolitan region

for decades we have strongly supported

congestion pricing because we think it

is a centerpiece of a set of policies

that will lead to a freedom more

equitable region congestion pricing will

reduce traffic congestion our estimates

show this program will decrease delay of

traffic by about 15 during busy periods

traffic levels are already surpassing

pre-coped levels so managing traffic is

key to our economic recovery congestion

pricing will raise vital revenue for

public transit the program will raise

115 billion in revenue and 100 of this

net revenue will go into paying for

improvements to our public

transportation system

congestion pricing will make the

transportation system more equitable the

majority of households in new york city

do not own cars and on average

households with cars have an income that

is nearly double those without we

produced a thorough report in 2019 that

analyzed a number of toll scenarios and

laid out recommendations for

implementation it is available for all

to read on our website at rpa.org key

recommendations from the report are as

follows implement transit and bicycle

improvements prior to starting

congestion pricing adopt specific

objectives and metrics to meet traffic

environmental and health goals and

ensure that benefits are equally shared

create a consistent toll rate for all

similar trips by providing total credits

to drivers and mta crossings to reduce

traffic for the cheapest souls we have

found that 25 of the am peak of traffic

on bqe is avoided during tolls on the

hugh carey tunnel to take advantage of

the free east river bridges introduce to

a tolling in the congestion zone and

vary the congestion fee by the level of

congestion at different times of day by

size of vehicle the mta should

incorporate these recommendations and

also analyze localized traffic impacts

in neighborhoods like washington heights

hybrids mott haven inwood along with

jersey city hoboken union city and fort

lee and new jersey thank you

===

hello my name is stephen bodson i live

in western queens

i'm here to complain about congestion

pricing i'm here to complain that it is

taking too long

the latest delays are being justified by

what the national environmental policy

act right

congestion pricing is obviously positive

for the environment it should be

improved with minimal review what's

causing environmental impact right now

is this review

this review is abetting politicians who

are just scared of doing anything about

traffic

this time-consuming process is delaying

the project and hurting the environment

i appreciate the emphasis on

environmental justice that's admirable

but it's ignoring the extra damage that

the delay causes to neighborhoods like

mine which are extraordinarily affected

by vehicle violence and pollution

congestion pricing as you've heard

plenty of times already today it will

help the region's air quality water

quality also safety from vehicular

violence it's going to provide income to

the mta

and reduce new york's contribution to

climate change

every day of delay has serious

environmental impacts

so i urge you to one

accelerate this review and two implement

congestion pricing as quickly as

possible thank you very much

thank you

our next speaker is tony malone followed

by benjamin turner

hi i'm tony malone and i live in

brooklyn

first i wanted to note that the two

assembly members and the member of

congress who spoke here against

congestion pricing didn't once mention

climate change we can't keep ignoring

the fact that climate change is going to

alter every aspect of life in new york

city

we need to transform our transportation

infrastructure so that every resident

can get around the city without adding

more pollution

a successful response to climate change

means getting people out of cars

congestion pricing is a great start and

it shouldn't take another 18 months for

us to implement a basic idea that has

already worked in other cities

it's important to remember that most new

york city households don't own a car as

other speakers have mentioned

and that those that do own a car have

almost twice the median income as those

who don't

low-income communities will benefit the

most from improving our subways buses

and other mass transit options we also

need to make our streets safer for

bicycles and pedestrians those are the

least expensive and least polluting

modes of transportation

i urge you not to give any exemptions to

city employees and those with

connections in local government

every day i see cars with placards or

vests on their dashboard parked in

pedestrian plazas and sidewalks around

brooklyn borough hall right next to

eight subway lines

government workers should be encouraged

to use transit like everyone else we're

all in this together finally i hope you

will consider this as just the start if

we're going to survive climate change we

need to keep implementing new policies

every year to discourage car use we also

need to keep offering better

transportation options throughout the

city

tolls and congestion charges should

increase yearly to reflect the true cost

of car dependency on our future climate

i hope that five years from now no one

would choose to commute regularly by car

in central new york city

thank you

===

hi there my name is ben turner and um

i'm i'd like to speak in in favor of of

congestion pricing i think it's long

overdue

uh look we all know it we can all see it

traffic auto traffic in new york city is

out of control

it's

take a look at any freeway around the

city uh during rush hour or even non

non-rush hours

most of them are congested with traffic

barely moving

but

sidewalks are

crosswalks are blocked sidewalks are

blocked in many cases

auto traffic is making the city

unlivable

and it's having the biggest impact on

middle and working class new yorkers

uh

assemblyman weapon spoke earlier and

claimed to speak for

middle class new yorkers

that's not who drives into manhattan

it's wealthier new yorkers there's

overwhelming evidence for that

and there's overwhelming evidence that

it's a choice that it's not a necessity

and it's luxury for well wealthy new

yorkers to be able to drive here

the city needs to do something about

climate change uh freeing up road space

and reorg

orienting it away from

vehicles for parking space will allow

more green space to absorb flooding

which is going to be likely in the area

in the era of

increased uh severe weather events

so the fewer

exemptions the better and i hope the

city and state also explore expanding it

in new areas like downtown flushing

where it takes half an hour to get by

bus from my neighborhood and bayside

into downtown flushing for the subway

solely because of auto

traffic please support climate change or

support congestion pricing it's a

necessary step in the city's future

thank you

===

um i wanted to speak in support of

congestion pricing i'll just make a few

points these have i think all been made

by others uh first is that this isn't

new

london does it and it works there we

should have done this many years ago the

second one is that it's fair car owners

are a minority and car owners are

generally wealthier than non-car owners

in this city we pay to get on the subway

we pay to get on the bus

we should be requiring payment from

drivers who want to get into the central

business district this will also benefit

drivers i'm sure everybody is familiar

with the experience of being stuck in

traffic in manhattan it is horrible the

status quo is not working and this may

assist in that

in general

driving is bad for the environment and

it is dangerous a few weeks ago

three-month-old baby was killed in

brooklyn by a car this is a

three-month-old baby

so

it becomes personal

that's all i'll say i think we should

implement this in a more aggressive

timeline another 16 months aren't

necessary to find out if it's

environmental to tall cars of course

it's environmental to toll cars what's

unenvironmental is not towing cars thank

you

===

hi my name is angel i'm a i live in

southern brooklyn i just wanted to speak

in support of congestion pricing the

area of manhattan below 60th street is

some of the most transit dense area in

the entire country it has access to four

commuter railroads

every subway line stops there with the

exception of one and every express bus

from the outer boroughs also stops at

some point in that area so there's

really no reason that anyone would

choose to drive into that

part of manhattan unless you are wealthy

enough to then make that choice for

yourself we all know that less than half

of the city owns cars and even a smaller

percentage of those people that own cars

then choose to use their cars to commute

into manhattan so we're talking about

wealthy people that are making that

choice and even in underserved

neighborhoods the people that own cars

in those underserved neighborhoods are

still wealthier than the folks that are

using transit and taking two or three

buses to then get to the subway i would

love to see an expansion of the city

ticket system especially in portions of

eastern queens as well as uh eastern

brooklyn as well so folks that are far

away from uh the subway but closer to an

lirr station can take advantage of that

and i would also encourage the mta to

not grant any exemptions especially for

municipal employees talking about police

officers firefighters that drive in from

long island and other parts outside of

the city and then park their cars

illegally on sidewalks in bus lanes in

bike lanes and create havoc for cyclists

pedestrians and other people that live

here

and lastly i would also hope that the

mta then uses funds to create more

accessible stations build more elevators

and ramps and stations to uh

it should be as accessible as possible

because we also know most

folks with disabilities use transit they

don't actually drive their cars all over

the place thank you

===

yes hello

can you hear me yes we can

yeah i got kicked off for some reason so

thanks for this opportunity my name is

chris hayward i live in brooklyn and

work in the cbd

most days i commute from park slope to

the flatiron district via bicycle

i am strongly in favor of congestion

pricing for many reasons first and

foremost is safety statistically drivers

are the biggest threat to my children's

lives as a cyclist i literally risk my

life every time i travel to or from my

workplace in the cbd

the extreme congestion in the cbd makes

the streets very dangerous for

pedestrians cyclists and drivers alike

as it leads to increased driver

aggression and creates especially unsafe

conditions including blocked crosswalks

and bike lanes

congestion pricing will reduce the

volume of cars traveling through the cbd

and the streets safer for all second the

heavy congestion results in high

pollution which i and other pedestrians

and cyclists are forced to breathe

congestion also results in excessive

noise pollution from drivers pointlessly

honking their horns when stuck in

traffic

third congestion handicaps bus services

which

disproportionately harms low-income new

yorkers

fourth the revenue that congestion

pricing will generate is sorely needed

to improve our public transit system

which is frankly a joke compared to

those in most european cities in terms

of reliability speed and comfort and it

can be very much improved with the

revenue that congestion pricing will

generate

there are many other reasons i

support congestion pricing but time is

limited i hope that the toll reflects

the true externalities associated with

driving to manhattan even the high end

of 23 dollars quoted at the beginning of

this call is too low congestion pricing

has been demonstrated to be very

successful in major cities such as

london would have similar positive

effects here i also hope that in the

future the congestion pricing zone has

expanded well beyond the cbd as many

other parts of the city would benefit

from congestion pricing and i would like

to see a less man manhattan centric plan

thank you

===

yes we can hear you

okay

thank you for hearing my testimony today

i'm a resident of southeastern queens

for six years

and i voiced my strong support of a

robust congestion pricing program in new

york city as quickly as possible the

central business district tolling

program will have ultra-positive

environmental physical

and mental impacts by reducing motor

vehicle congestion clearing the air of

excessive emissions

and raising funds that will be invested

in delivering cleaner and faster

transportation for millions of people

a lot of us commute to work in manhattan

you got both long inconsistent

inaccessible commutes on the subway and

bus and slow moving traffic and

frustration with parking

the goal of funding transit improvements

is to make it more feasible for drivers

to switch to transit

making it easier for the remaining

drivers who really need four wheels

being low income myself i'm actually in

front of a library right now trying to

get good wi-fi without disturbing anyone

else

transit fares might be expensive but the

congestion toll is nothing compared to

the full cost of a car that are

exorbitantly out of reach in the first

place

transit and cycling are the only

legitimately affordable mobility and

there's no cbd surcharge with these

methods but also i don't want to drive

it seems very stressful and mentally

unhealthy between other mad drivers your

responsibility to not injure or kill

other street users

and knowing you're contributing to the

traffic you want to get rid of and to

climate change

there are others like me who don't drive

most households in the city don't own a

car students go students go to school by

bus etc so congestion pricing is in our

interest to serve many locals and it's

not the poor people regression or tax

many are saying it is

thank you very much once again

you

===

thank you and thank you for the

opportunity to speak my name is sandra

voss and i'm a resident of the bronx i'm

a strong supporter of congestion pricing

the issue of prioritizing people over

cars in our city is one that is close to

my heart as my brother-in-law was killed

by a driver last year while riding his

bike outside of boston

we are facing a traffic violence

epidemic in nyc with a 30 percent jump

in traffic related fatalities between

june 2020 and july 2021

reducing the number of cars in new york

city will help to reduce traffic

violence

even setting aside the issue of traffic

violence new york has never been a city

for driving

according to 2018 census estimates the

majority of nyc households did not own a

car including 60 percent of bronx

households most of us therefore get

around by subway bus walking or biking

anyone who regularly uses these modes of

transportation is aware that they are

all in need of increased funding and

infrastructure which will both be

achieved through the revenue generated

from the congestion pricing plan

the more we continue to cater to drivers

in our city the more our buses and

emergency vehicles will continue to be

slowed by traffic and the more our

transit system will continue to be

plagued by delays and outdated systems

some opponents of the plan have

suggested that residents of the outer

boroughs will be negatively impacted

because they lack good transit options

but the answer to this problem is not to

continue to rely on cars to fill the

gaps in transit the answer is to improve

transit and reduce reliance on cars

furthermore given the climate crisis

which disproportionately affects

low-income communities

there is no excuse for continuing to

allow so many cars to clog our streets

and pollute our air cities around the

globe like paris are taking impressive

steps to reduce the number of cars and

prioritize transit biking and walking it

will be a global embarrassment if new

york city does not act to implement

congestion pricing as soon as possible

thank you

===

good morning i am felicia park rogers

and i'm the director of regional

infrastructure projects for tri-state

transportation campaign an advocacy and

policy organization fighting for

sustainable mobility in new york new

jersey and connecticut

we strongly support the implementation

of congestion pricing we have always

understood that congestion pricing is

not simply about the tolling system but

about the toll that traffic congestion

and air pollution exacts on the

livability of our city and the health

and well-being of our most vulnerable

communities both in new york city and

throughout the region

new york must rise to the challenge of

significantly scaling back greenhouse

gas emissions to achieve an 85 percent

reduction and 100 net zero carbon

emission economy by 2050. this goal

requires a rapid reshaping of the

economy and how we view the urban

environment as one of the most climate

vulnerable and diverse coastal cities

new york city must lead the way for

major cities nationally and around the

world

since the devastating impact of super

storm sandy in 2012 we have been at the

front line of the crime climate crisis

that will continue to negatively impact

the entire city torrential downpours and

flash flooding like what we saw in

recent weeks are expected to occur more

frequently and become even more severe

we must act now to reduce carbon

emissions from the transportation sector

and this starts with implementing

congestion pricing not only is this a

win for the environment and for public

health it's also a win for millions of

transit riders who rely on a transit

system that needs new revenue streams to

fund its multi-billion dollar capital

campaign

within the 30 counties that make up the

project study area 52 are residents of

color and 13

of residents have household incomes

below the poverty line according to the

mta the vast majority of commuters into

manhattan's cbd reach their destination

by public transit and low-income people

represent the largest share of

public transit readers riders in new

york city i'm almost done while

congestion pricing by itself won't solve

every transportation challenge our city

faces it is an integral part of a larger

strategy tri-state has been fighting for

congestion pricing for well over a

decade and now is the time thank you

===

all right can you all hear me

yes we can okay good afternoon everyone

i'm bradley beshear's planning manager

at the permanent citizens advisory

committee to the mta pcac

i'm also an avid runner from queens

where i begin my day early alongside

increasing car traffic heading into

manhattan's core making my run even more

difficult and dangerous

as i continue to play roulette with cars

every morning i

the more i realize the need for

congestion pricing now more than ever

congestion pricing is the only feasible

way to substantially raise funds for the

mta without raising or fares bringing in

a steady stream of money for key

improvements for the region's transit

system

especially in the wake of low ridership

thanks to kova 19 and worsening climate

change the billions of dollars that

congestion pricing will bring could not

be more important for riders across the

system

particularly relevant this climate week

the environmental benefits of congestion

pricing cannot be understated as we

tragically learn from historic storms

and flooding this summer the mta needs

infrastructure funding as it's faced

with the herculean task of building a

resilient regional transit system that

can withstand the forces of extreme

weather we already know that efficient

reliable transit is the way to get

drivers out of their cars congestion

pricing will bring the billions of

dollars we need to repair our transit

while also improving air quality

decreasing traffic around the five

boroughs and making new york a less car

dependent city

outer borough residents have infinite

reasons to be excited about congestion

pricing thousands of essential projects

and jobs rely on the 15 billion it will

bring in when bonded including

modernizing signals on 13 subway lines

building new elevators and more than 44

stations adding thousands of new buses

and train cars repairing century old

infrastructure and expanding bus service

constant bumper-to-bumper traffic can be

a thing of the past bringing a better

quality of life and faster bus commutes

to communities not just in the cbd but

all over the city

riders deserve reliable and frequent

service across our subways buses and

commuter realm finally thanks to

congestion pricing the 21st century

transit system new yorkers desperately

need 

===

i live in queens and i work in kearney

new jersey uh this congestion pricing

would double my miles to get there to

avoid the congestion pricing that double

miles basically translates to double my

pollution that would be same thing for

anybody else that was made in your

presentation earlier uh people trying to

avoid going through manhattan because

they need to get to brooklyn from new

jersey or whatever direction

so basically what i foresee is a circle

of smog an increase in pollution in the

whole area because of this

the other thing is why can't we just use

parking is the equalizer

basically if you do decrease congestion

these parking lots are going to go out

of business and so has anybody

considered that environmental impact

and also with uber

let's try to follow the money why are

they putting so much money into

this congestion pricing i'm really

wondering what's going on here uh then

finally

the people that are attacking the police

in this conversation i wish you'd stop

doing that the police do protect us and

they are the people that are important

to me thank you

===

i'm a resident of the east bronx i'm a

subway rider an express bus rider a

cyclist and a pedestrian i'm urging for

the swift implementation of the central

business district tolling program with

minimal exemptions

driving to the central business district

is a choice that far too many people are

taking for trips that are almost always

better accomplished by public transit

the congestion on our streets threaten

the health and safety of the vast

majority of new yorkers who make the

right choice those who walk take transit

and bike to their destinations

it is a choice i'm originally from the

eastern edge of queens and even though i

lived more than three miles away from

the subway terminal in a so-called

transit desert that was never an excuse

to take a car into manhattan i took the

bus and subway daily to get to manhattan

with a small percentage of folks who

actually need to drive to the central

business district the congestion on our

streets isn't working for them either

let's make the choice easier we need to

do everything in the toolbox to

discourage driving and congestion

pricing is a very effective tool we must

utilize we have to speed up this process

because we should have had this program

a decade ago

we should also have minimal exemptions

and cutouts to reduce the abuse of such

exemptions we already see too much

corruption in the form of placard abuse

the motorcycle exemption sounds okay but

otherwise let's not water this down

thank you

===

okay and you cut my video okay um

good morning thank you for the

opportunity to speak my name is neil

weissman i head up complete george 200

organizations communities and public

officials calling for wider bikeways

across the george washington bridge i

just posted a link in the q a

um

yeah all right i just i posted a link in

the q a i bring here attention a

proposal for new york city d.o.t and

parks to designate 500 miles of urban

bikeways this network would reduce

resident cost of travel extend access to

green space and provide numerous

opportunities for exercise and

recreation consistent with the goals of

the towing program it would mitigate

congestion improve air quality bridge

transport deserts and facilitate

multimodal trips in the outer boroughs

in tokyo a city of 13 million where 90

percent commute by mass transit one

third bike the first and last mile

this network would harden up transport

grid against widespread outage in the

days following super storm sandy bike

traffic across east river bridges surged

from 13 000 per day to 30 000

and making it easier to making it easier

and safer to bike is our most cost

effective tool to reduce greenhouse

emissions from transport

a key impediment to the scheme however

are mta 7 toll bridges which are ideally

placed to facilitate bike travel to the

outer boroughs but do not currently

support cycling therefore i call on the

mta to embrace the biagi gonzalez rojas

bikes on bridge advisory board and to

allocate the resources needed to affect

their recommendations

thank you

===

my name is lucia deng and i live in the

bronx i live in one of the outer

boroughs that

some of your commenters have been saying

are going to be

unfairly impacted by this congestion

pricing toll i just wanted to say that i

completely disagree

and i think that folks in the outer

boroughs are going to be

um

really happy to have increased

funding directed at transit

improving our

buses and subways

you know in my neighborhood in the bronx

almost 90 percent of the residents do

not drive to work so when people say

comments such as oh well this toll is

going to

unfairly impact

the poor folks that's just completely

disingenuous

the vast majority of people

who live in the bronx actually do

commute via buses and trains and other

modes and not cars so um you know we

really need to speed up the approval

process for this

it's just going to benefit everyone and

we need to really shift the incentives

in the city away from using personal

vehicles away from being able to store

cars on the street taking up valuable

space for free

it's about time that drivers

and and car owners pay their fair share

thanks everyone

===

there we go hi everyone my name is alexa

jacob and i am currently a student um i

study at the cooper union in manhattan

which is with the cbd i also live in

queens um so i've been taking the subway

to school ever since our new semester

started um and i would really love to

bike i love biking i bike all over the

city but the thing is biking in new york

city kind of sucks

um whenever i bike in lower manhattan uh

cars always get angry at me i stay in

the bike lane i wear my helmet i do all

the stops i am like a very good cyclist

but

cars are just like violent towards me um

and that's something that i think we

could change if we implement pedestrian

pricing because driving makes you angry

especially when there's traffic um

and that kind of anger leads to road

rage and recently traffic violence and

that hurts people so congestion pricing

i think is really necessary because i

want to be able to bike to school i want

to feel safe doing so and that is

something that congestion pricing could

help something i also care a lot about

is climate change you know i'm a student

i'm pretty young i have my whole life

ahead of me except for climate change

it's gonna ruin that so let's not ruin

that um i think that new york city could

be a much more climate forward city if

we get rid of our dependence on cars and

if we incentivize other forms of

transportation some people are saying

that it's gonna disadvantage people who

are getting double told

first off the staten island theory is

free um you guys have a free way to get

off the island um but also like

i think it's fine disadvantaged people

who are causing climate chaos

and we should advantage people who are

not

um

and they like as a lot of other people

have said um

drivers need to pay their fair share i

love passing cars in manhattan because

they're always stuck in gridlock but

then they get angry at me and that's bad

so let's just have more condition

pricing sooner thank you

===

hey uh hello and thank you

for holding this my name is pedro

rodriguez and i lived in new york city

for about 20 years now i grew up in the

bronx i now live in central queens i'm a

walker a transect taker a new driver i

got my license and bought a car doing

the pandemic so i'm one of those

one of those

and i now have a bike due to uh the new

bike lanes that keep expanding

everywhere

we need congestion pricing uh pollution

from smoke tires noise makes new york

city a place that's hostile to raising a

family something that i want to do

this kind of pollution leads to ask my

kids the noise makes putting a kid down

to sleep impossible

is it any wonder that when people uh

people come to new york city they make a

bunch of money and then they live

leaving immediately they want to make a

family that's something they're able to

to leave i know it's no wonder it is a

hostile city to raise a family in

new york city is one of the few places

in the united states where you are where

you don't need to have a car and this

increases child independence which

studies have shown have a great effect

on the child's mental development

studies have also shown that it has a

great effect in the parents

mental stress because it gives them more

free time i mean

just just think about how much time a

parent gets

back if they don't need to chaperone

their kids around until the age of 16 or

18 in some places uh but this is this

independence this child independence is

being stifled by traffic pollution noise

and general car hazards like block

sidewalks and and reckless drivers and

although congestion pricing is only

gonna happen in manhattan it's gonna

affect everywhere due to uh induced

demand i would prefer uh new york city

to have a bigger congestion pricing

uh than what we have right now

especially around all the denser places

in new york city not just manhattan

congestion pricing is going to help turn

your city from a place where people come

to make money and they move out once

they want to have a family to a place

where families want to come here and

thrive in so they can have healthy

independent children so please implement

congestion pricing as soon as possible

thank you

===

how you doing my name is jose hernandez

i am the president of the new york city

chapter of united spinal association i'm

also a person with a physical disability

i am not against um the

central

central business district tolling

program

however um as a person who does a lot of

business in the central business and a

person with a disability that drives a

wheelchair accessible minivan

i believe that there should be an

exemption for individuals who have the

parking permit for people with physical

disabilities as i

work with the mayor's office for people

with disabilities i'm also one of the

commissioners of the civic engagement

commission and we host meetings in city

hall or whenever i'm advocating at 250

broadway and i need to get down there as

we know that the mta doesn't have a lot

of accessibility and getting around the

city is very difficult for people with

disabilities

but with that being said i do support it

because it will increase this

accessibility but

you know we need to make sure that

individuals who with disabilities who do

drive can get around um easily and are

exempt from the

new tool

thank you

===

sorry i was muted there good afternoon

my name is eric mcclure on behalf of

streets pack a political action

committee and advocacy organization

dedicated to improving public transit

and making city streets safer i'm here

today to urge the speedy and complete

adoption of the central business

district holding program

traffic congestion costs new yorkers

hundreds of hours and lost time and

productivity every year and in the

aggregate tens of billions of dollars in

lost economic activity new york city's

congestion is the worst in the nation

and that congestion underlies a heavy

environmental and health burden motor

vehicles stuck in gridlock pollute the

city's air and sickened its residents

and it's getting worse according to the

latest data traffic in new york city is

now at 115 percent of pre-pandemic

levels this is an untenable epically bad

situation that will only get worse

without decisive action

at the same time our public transit

system so essential to the city's

success and well-being suffers greatly

from under investment the current record

five-year capital plan for which funding

sources are still sketchy at best will

only just begin to address the system's

needs and represents a mere down payment

on the world class transit system new

yorkers deserve the central business

district polling program however will go

a long way toward addressing the dual

challenges of crushing congestion and

adequate capital funding similar efforts

in stockholm singapore and london have

markedly reduced congestion and sped up

travel times and the bonded revenue from

congestion pricing will yield a reliable

revenue stream of billions of dollars

for capital improvements the benefits of

faster commutes reduced air pollution

and upgraded transit service will endure

to those new yorkers who need the most

the working people who actually depend

on their cars for their livelihoods or a

reliable bus for subway commute to work

and the ej communities who for far too

long have borne the brunt of pollution

and the noise and danger from relentless

vehicle traffic the mta the governor and

the other responsible entities must move

expeditiously as possible to complete

the environmental assessment any work

that can be carried out simultaneously

such as installation of towing

coordinates and appointment of the

traffic mobility review board members

should proceed to pace congestion

pricing was approved two and a half

years ago and new yorkers can't wait an

equivalent amount of time for its

implementation our need for action is

immediate thank you

===

hello everyone i hope you can hear me

thank you for the opportunity to speak

today i would like to thank the mta for

hosting this event it is very important

that myself other elected officials and

of course the public are able to speak

on this issue my name is stacey pfeffer

romano and i'm the new york state

assemblywoman who represents the 23rd

assembly district and i've been talking

about years about toll equity because in

my district we have the only intraborrow

bridge in new york state the cross bay

veterans memorial bridge this bridge

goes from one part of queens through

another matter of fact it cuts right in

the middle of my assembly district so

people in the north of my district who

want to come south must pay a toll it

connects the rockaway peninsula to the

mainland of queens it was built in 1939

and then expanded in 1970 when the

crow's feet bridge was first constructed

the toll was only 10 cents a trip and

designed only to cover the cost of

building and building new improvements

however the cost of the bridge now is

4.25

this is a huge deterrent in the air in

my area which allows residents

um it stops residents from visiting our

public beaches but most importantly

again the residents in the north of my

district less than five miles must pay a

toll to go to the public hospital public

beaches churches synagogues and public

school and most importantly to go to

work

if we're going to discuss toll equity

we're going to talk about talk about

creating a new funding source like the

central business district then we should

also commit to this bully and eliminate

the toll on the crossfade bridge for

once and for all thank you for this time

thank you

good evening i like to give comments

regarding congestion pricing

so

first things first

this has to be done as quickly as

possible because

the traffic is getting worse and worse

by the day

i particularly notice it a lot even in

the otterboroughs

the long island expressway in grand

central parkway numerous examples i can

give

also main roads like francis lewis

boulevard where the q76 for an example

gets stuck in traffic

jamaica avenue for another example where

the q3231

gets stuck in traffic

this idea

of implementing congestion pricing in

manhattan

is the start

but afterwards

what we need to evaluate

is looking at congestion pricing for

other areas of the five boroughs outside

of manhattan

where

you see a lot of congestion

i can go on and on and on on numerous

examples but i just gave examples for

queens just to prove a point

so

i will mention that i did

speak in favor of congestion pricing at

the july mta finance committee meeting

i will mention that we are now the worst

traffic city in the whole country

you can look at texas a m we beat los

angeles

that's very alarming

so

we have to get this done as quickly as

possible

the traffic is getting worse

day by day

congestion pricing must be done

now

thank you all very much for letting me

speak to you this evening

===
george batman yes my name is george

bettman and i am marauders alliance

member from brooklyn

i am here to testify for the need to

implement congestion pricing as soon as

possible fares continue to go up with no

noticeable improvement in service

this is in good part after years of

divestment our bus and subway system

need so much work on its infrastructure

such as an improved signaling system for

the subways track maintenance and the

installation of escalators and elevators

so people with disabilities can access

the buses and subways

a modern signal system will allow trains

to run on time

eliminating a lot of the delays that

riders now experience

there are also a large number of riders

including myself

that depend on escalators and elevators

to get around the subway system we often

walk far distances and travel way out of

our way just to find one of the few

accessible stations only to find out

that the elevator is broken

if i find an elevator that's broken that

does not work i am forced to use the

stairs and it takes me forever to get to

the platform because i have to take one

step at a time

because of this i miss my train i have

the same problem going up the stairs and

a lot of people behind me get pissed off

because i am so slow i have to take one

step at a time and as i said the people

are in behind me are in the rush they

want to get around me and they can't do

so

we need to do better at now and that

means investing in our transit system an

increase in fares does not cover the

cost of the necessary improvements the

running public can contribute only so

much for improvements that is why i am

here today to get the necessary funding

to get the infrastructure changes made

and to improve bus and subway service

the money that congestion pricing will

bring in will do so much to improve our

transit system

thank you very much

cheryl can you hear me now

we can

yes uh

can you see me

uh

your camera is currently off

uh

there i am thank you

uh i'm cheryl stewart representing

riders against congestion i'm a

co-founder of the new york motorcycle

and scooter task force and a founding

member of the sirens women's motorcycle

club in addition i serve on the

motorcycle advisory council convened by

new york city dot to work on motorcycle

safety issues

i'm a professional freelance artist i

live in red hook brooklyn which is a

neighborhood poorly served by public

transportation

many of my workdays find me transporting

my sculpture tools

which

reciprocal saws chisels mallets keyhole

saws giant

calipers even if i had access to a

subway and red hook i would still need

to use private vehicle to transport

myself and my tools to work

my co-workers load up their giant pickup

trucks i strap my tools on the back of

my fuel-efficient congestion-reducing

motorcycle

the primary goal as stated here of

congestion pricing is reducing new york

city's notorious traffic our small

lightweight vehicles have an outsized

effect reducing traffic congestion in

fact sam schwartz himself authored a

report in 2008 demonstrating that even a

small mode shift away from autos and

towards motorbikes would result in

enormous decreases in traffic delays and

a commensurate reduction in co2

emissions

motorcycles are granted a 100 exemption

from congestion-based trolling in london

as well as in stockholm milan the entire

country of germany and every european

city

where congestion pricing has been

successfully imposed

incentivizing motorcycles is part of

their congestion reduction strategy

danny harris executive director of

transportation alternatives has said

that transalt wants new york city to

adopt the london congestion pricing plan

in its entirety

we agree

as they do in london the infantry

markets grant motorcycles a 100 percent

exemption from congestion-based tolling

as a part

strategy

===
can you hear me

yes you can okay my name is susan lazar

and i'm a resident of brooklyn for 33

years i'm a wife and a mother

i'm also a pledge to the sirens women's

motorcycle club of new york city in 2018

i needed to take employment with the

company located in weehawken new jersey

commuting by public transportation is

not a viable option

at an absolute minimum public

transportation no matter what route i

took is two hours in one direction

that's four hours a day by public

transportation

at a cost of 23.50

a day along with walking over two miles

taking two subway trains as well as a

ferry boat

this takes a valuable time away from my

family and my life

so three years ago at age 50 i got my

motorcycle license and i drove my

motorcycle to work

this has been able to reduce my commute

time down to three hours a day

i still pay tolls of 17 a day having no

other way to cross than either the

lincoln or the holland tunnel and i'm

very concerned by the map i see and how

this is going to affect me

if motorcycles are not exempt my tools

will be more than 30 dollars a day just

to get to my job although my motorcycle

riding started out for my personal time

and cost savings

i realized that i was benefiting this

city that i love so much

i use far less gas and take up far less

space than one car

i reduce the weight on our bridges i'm

reducing congestion and reducing

pollution from idling vehicles

if motorcycles are not exempt from

congestion pricing i will be being

punished

by this city for doing what is right

london understands the benefit that

motorcycles bring over cars and supports

them with a 100 percent exemption

i ask that new york city do the same

please give motorcycles a 100 percent

exemption thank you

===

a new engine

yes

all right we can hear you okay

good evening my name is anuranjan pego i

work at an environmental non-profit and

have been involved with environmental

and social justice issues for many years

i've always supported congestion pricing

in other cities wherever there's

congestion pricing for environmental

reasons

and i feel that this tolling program

should be more sincere when it comes to

environment and social equity

this plan is inspired by other

congestion pricing systems of the world

where

uh it has been proven to be successful

in reducing congestion and pollution and

that is why we should follow those

models very closely and one thing that

these have in common all the systems

that exist is the 100 exemption that

they give to motorcycles why did they do

that many people have already talked

about the lower carbon dioxide emissions

the great fuel economy the less wear and

tear on roadways the ability to park six

motorcycles in one parking spot and of

course their ability to reduce

congestion it is scientific logical

proven and common sense idea in london

even in their ultra low emission zone

motorcycles made after 2007 are still

100 exempted from that toll the other

big thing that existing plans also taken

to factor is uh social equity

motorcycles cheap affordable means of

transportation for a lot of middle and

low-income people especially for those

who cannot afford to live in downtown

areas cars or um public transport does

not work i live south of prospect park

it takes me about 60 minutes to get to

my work and flat iron district but on a

motorcycle it can take 30 minutes the

same for many of the people who live

south of where i do

um

so basically it makes it more like the

more affordable accessible the easily

adoptable than lesser bicycles it would

take me much more longer and i'll be

tired getting to work on a bicycle and

trains

are always delayed around where i live

uh to sum up conjunction pricing

everywhere in the western world gives

100 exemption to motorcycles because

motorcycles have been proven to reduce

congestion and pollution while bringing

social equity and i hope that the mta is

serious about doing

uh getting those two aims because it is

a very common sense and the right things

to do yes thank you

===

hello can you hear me

yes we can my name is sandra fleming i

am a social worker and motorcycle rider

i use my motorcycle to visit

four to six patients daily i'm required

by the agency that i work for which is a

home care visiting agency to use a

vehicle of not public transportation

because we would not be able to see

enough patients

i often do areas where there is no

parking the only option has been to use

the motorcycle to be as efficient as

possible not only efficient

to park but also we i am sincerely

congesting reducing i too attempted to

use a bicycle to compute but it was too

slow and i would i would arrive sweaty

and

too exhausted to do my job efficiently i

see that the city has gone to extreme

efforts to support

non-motorized vehicles meaning

two-wheeled vehicles meeting bicycles

there are lanes all over the place we

take not much more footprint than a

bicycle so it's unreasonable to believe

that we would not be afforded the same

luxury the same

the same uh benefits uh

given that we are so congested reducing

so i too call for 100 exemption

from congestion pricing from

motorcyclists

anyone riding a

vehicle that is not contributing to the

problem should not be taxed for the

problem

thank you

===

hello can you hear me

yes

i'm having trouble hearing you i'm so

sorry i'm here i will start talking in

one second

okay i can't see my notes anymore but

here we go

um my name is kristin o'reilly i am a

high school special education teacher

who works at a new york city department

of education

high school below 60th street in

manhattan

i'm a homeowner in district 40 in

brooklyn and

i too am here to advocate for a 100

exemption to the tolling program for

motorcycles um i commute to work on my

motorcycle

this is a

fuel efficient cost-effective

affordable way to commute

i also take the subway but

riding my motorcycle provides me with an

opportunity to physical distance

um get fresh air enjoy my commute reduce

my commute time um

and stop at local businesses uh along my

route to and from work in order to

spend money

to support new york city's economy

motorcycles

motorcycle

tolling exemptions exist in major cities

throughout the world

if london can do it we can do it too

that's it thanks so much

thank you

===

hi good evening thank you for the

opportunity to testify my name is john

cho

i'm a resident of queens new york where

i've lived more than two decades i'm

also executive director of the greater

flushing chamber of commerce

the only multicultural membership

association representing the fourth

largest business district in new york

the mta must implement a robust

congestion pricing program in new york

city as quickly as possible

not only will congestion pricing support

regional sustainable development by

reducing card congestion and pollution

but also helps save a vital

transportation system relied on by

millions of people including the local

residents and small business owners of

flushing

flushing is one of the largest

intermodal transportation hubs in new

york and our business community depends

on fast reliable transit options for our

customers and workers as well as the

delivery of goods and services across

our region

unfortunately the lack of public

investment has made our transit system

and impediments not a facilitator for

economic development the two dozen bus

routes that go through our community are

some of the slowest in the city and the

7 train has become reliably unreliable

we must fix the system now further delay

will not only increase the cost of

future maintenance and upgrades but will

have a catastrophic impact on our small

business owners who have suffered

during the pandemic not only during the

lockdown but also from acts of

anti-asian violence

we urge the mta to double the planned

rate charges for the proposed congestion

pricing program

increasing the rate charges would not

only help fund the mta capital plan but

also provide an opportunity to reduce or

even eliminate the fare for subway and

bus riders a reduction or elimination of

the fare would help jump-start ridership

on the mta system which went into a

death spiral during the pandemic

as a predominantly immigrant working

class community of color often

overlooked by policymakers fleshy would

benefit from a no fair subway and bus

system

which would further the cause of

environmental justice throughout the

region thank you

===

timothy my name is timothy gillis

president of the park slope civic

council which was formed in 1896 and is

one of the oldest civic associations in

the entire city

many members of the council and of our

board of trustees own cars including my

wife and i

you might think this would lead us based

in an outer borough to oppose congestion

pricing but you would be wrong

in june 2007 when the idea was first

discussed seriously the civic council

rent went on record in favor

on november 1st that year two members of

our livable streets committee michael

carroll who went on to become our

president and lori schindler who remains

a key leader on our board of trustees

testified at a public hearing held by

the congestion mitigation commission

their testimony in favor of congestion

pricing was thoughtful and compelling

and i would like to submit it for the

record in this hearing

they argued that congestion pricing

would benefit the entire city by

unclogging streets facilitating freer

flow of commerce creating safer

conditions for pedestrians and cyclists

increasing subway and bus ridership and

generating revenue for mass transit 14

years later those remain highly

desirable outcomes

in 2007 they also focused on several

issues particular to our park slope

neighborhood the severe congestion on

4th avenue 8th avenue and flatbush

avenue and the choke points at atlantic

terminal in downtown brooklyn

without congestion pricing they said

planned new high-rise construction would

make what was already unacceptably

congested even worse and that's exactly

what has happened

the civic council went on record again

in 2015 in support of the move new york

plan and in 2019 when the state

legislature finally took up the issue we

sent a letter to our legislators signed

by our then president joe rydell which

i'm also submitting for the record

we recognize that congestion pricing

would impact different neighborhoods

different commercial sectors and

different socioeconomic groups in

different ways the mta and our elected

officials should consider mitigation but

only where the need to avoid severe

hardship or gross inequity is truly

compelling congestion pricing needs

and it needs to happen now

thank you

===

hi my name is lula and i am a resident

of parakoui in which i have lived since

1994 which is about 26 years public

transportation is not viable in my area

the closest public transportation is a

not

extension from this available

price it takes about via by car or

motorcycle it takes about 45 minutes an

hour which cuts the transportation time

by by in half so i believe that we

should not be punished as far away

residents which will normally get

neglected by mta we should not be

punished for

using our cars or

motorcycles in order for us to cut the

transportation in half

thank you

thank you

our next feature will be thomas proctor

followed by linda braun

hi there uh my name is thomas proctor uh

i'm

a resident of the south bronx one of the

poorest areas in our nation uh

when talking about suggestion pricing i

hear a lot of

both political leaders and

neighbors of mine who drive or concerned

about their ability to pay this toll

well i sympathize with that we have

one of the highest rates of asthma here

in the south bronx in the nation

despite the very low rate of driving

that

exists here

cars are choking our kids

they're choking us and

i

ask that

congestion pricing be implemented as

soon as possible

the

idea that we are delaying congestion

pricing for

months on end for an environmental

review

is

just

the the definition of a kafka s

uh broken bureaucracy

this is the most environmentally

necessary

intervention

that is available to our city it's gonna

discourage the most environmentally

damaging form of transportation that's

available

it'll free up our roads for the

efficient operation of our buses which

have been

dropping in ridership

consistently for the past few years

provide funds and

for repairing our subways and i hope

that you can implement it

sooner than the

long schedule that's that's

been set out thank you

thank you

===

good evening my name is linda baron i'm

the president of the staten island

chamber of commerce

thank you for the opportunity to testify

tonight in the past our organization has

supported congestion pricing

primarily when sam schwartz was

proposing it

our concerns are

the the money that is collected uh for

congestion pricing that we see

improvement in the outer boroughs on

staten island we have limited

transportation options and uh the goal

of this is to get cars off the road and

uh because of the fact that we don't

have a lot of transit options especially

to get into manhattan we have express

buses which are very expensive a lot of

people do drive because they have no

other choice the ferry is a free option

but if you're a commercial vehicle you

can't take it over the staten island

ferry one of the things that's very

important to us is not being double told

we have commercial vehicles that spend

you know sometimes a hundred dollars for

a you know a two-way trip over the

bridge uh if they get told again when

they enter the commercial district

that's going to be a hardship puts them

at a competitive disadvantage there are

other areas of the city that do not have

tolls on their bridges uh really what

i'm asking for tonight is equity for

staten island for some investment in

staten island in our transportation

options and just to be treated fairly i

believe that if we want a system that

gets cars off the road and investment is

made investment means need made

throughout the entire city in the outer

boroughs as well as manhattan and uh

those are the things that are important

to us just not only for staten island

but everybody should be paying their

fair share thank you

thank you

===

hi

can you hear me now

yes

um

hi my name is edward huero um

when

when i i was born in coney island

while the summer season

while the summer season is almost over

we need to review the um the

streets from

south avenue when they have congestion

and they and on the between

west

west 82 all the way to 37th street

and when when i see the cars going in

and out to from the streets get

congested

once

and once they have suggested the bus

could not go through to every traffic

i want to know how to to review the

the congestion pricing in coney island

thank you very much

thank you

===

hi yes good evening jason anthony from

the amazon naval union

uh

i'm in full support of congestion

pricing but

those who live in certain

neighborhoods within

the

central business district only area

have to pay their fair share

and

amazon workers

who drive and commute

from

different areas from the five worlds in

new jersey

uh will be potentially affected by this

and don't forget

death vessels have a penthouse

within the

central business district home area

and also consider having a gas tax like

new jersey is going to benefit new

jersey transit

so

let's do the correct things to not only

benefit

riders but to benefit

uh

drivers so that's all i'm saying thank

you very much

thank you

===

i'm here

we can hear you

good evening i'm vittorio bugatti leader

and founder of the express plus advocacy

group like thousands of commuters in my

advocacy group i'm a proud outer borough

new yorker a born and raised brooklynite

a former staten islander and a current

resident of riverdale we in my advocacy

group live in transit deserts on staten

island and brooklyn queens and the bronx

in dozens of neighborhoods without

subways our express buses are our

subways if congestion pricing is

implemented the mta must agree to the

following first maintain expand and

improve its press bus service the

original proposed express bus redesigns

for the bronson queens had significant

cuts to the spans and frequencies of the

service along with the complete

elimination of lines such as the qm3 and

qm18

additionally we must finally have a

reliable and affordable transit system

more people are driving because service

continues to be unreliable and there are

service heights every other year

canceling express bus service and

leaving two hour gaps almost daily

cannot continue to be the norm for areas

such as southeast brooklyn another large

subway desert it is an arty for

the mta to say that it wants people to

leave their cars at home but

simultaneously propose to cut express

bus service to dozens of neighborhoods

citywide

which have the longest commutes in the

country and the least transportation

options second the environmental impact

study

include research about how much transit

would be needed to accommodate the

influx of riders that the system would

see along with the with an

implementation time frame for increased

services anything less is an insult to

thousands of outer borough commuters who

have historically been undeserved by the

mta

finally a said study must include a

mitigation plan to address the potential

increase in vehicular congestion in the

outer boroughs from suburban commuters

trying to avoid the congestion fee thank

you

thank you

===

uh

good evening can you hear me

my name is carlos castell croak and i am

a lifelong brooklyn resident an avid

transit and climate advocate and a

representative from the new york league

of conservation voters

as hurricane i as hurricane ida barreled

through the northeast earlier this month

it made it one truth abundantly clear

climate change is no longer a future

threat it is here and we are woefully

underprepared

given this reality new york must do

everything in its power to drastically

reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and

upgrade our infrastructure become more

resilient

fortunately new york has already

approved a program that will do all this

and more congestion pricing

congestion pricing will take dirty

polluting cars off of our most congested

roads and in turn provide crucial

funding to the mta so it can make much

needed infrastructure upgrades

we cannot drive our way out of this

climate crisis cars are the number one

polluter from new york's transportation

sector contributing 36 percent of

climate pollution as well as air

pollution so incentivizing commuters to

get out of their cars and on to public

transportation will be a massive step

toward the emission reduction targets

set far in landmark climate legislation

such as the clcpa

this program is required to raise 1

billion year over year promising to

support 15 billion for the mta's capital

plan investment all the more necessary

due to lost revenue during the copa 19

pandemic

this revenue will further help the mta

invest in resilient infrastructure to

help protect our vulnerable subways from

flooding in a world where storm surge is

increasingly common

in dressing pricing will also make our

streets safer our public transit more

reliable and accessible and expand our

system to serve even more new yorkers

new york needs congestion pricing now to

ensure that we are effectively tackling

climate the climate crisis while

investing in our critical transit

infrastructure thank you

thank you

===

good evening

my name is monica bartley

community organizer at the center for

independence of the disabled new york

sydney supports congestion pricing

initiative for people entering new york

city use utilizing a motor vehicle

this initiative could generate 15

billion towards funding the mta capital

plan

many people with disabilities are denied

the use of the subway because of

inaccessibility however sydney wants to

ensure that people with disabilities are

not disadvantaged economically by these

tax

the mta must clarify how exemptions the

congestion pricing will impact specific

populations particularly new yorkers

with disabilities who may be exempt from

congestion fees what groups are captured

by the phrase qualifying vehicles

transporting people with disabilities at

a minimum it must include all types of

accessibility vehicles office for people

with developmental disabilities vehicles

wheelchair accessible cabs

and other private vehicles used to

transport people with disabilities

people with disabilities must not be

burdened with additional costs needed to

rectify the in inaccessibility of the

subway system

however we acknowledged without the

funding from congestion pricing the

capital plan is at risk along with the

promised accessibility improvements and

ada compliance for the subway system to

ensure that the mta delivers on its

promise of increased accessibility we

need congestion pricing to begin as soon

as possible thank you very much

thank you

===

can you hear me

yes

oh hi

um good evening everyone my name is june

mages and i'm a member of the writers

alliance and i live in jamaica queens

i'm voicing my support for implementing

the justin pricing and i have two

reasons the first reason is because it

would help our transit system be more

accessible and reliable with funding

needed for improvements like elevators

and bus upgrades

as a senior item drive you can't walk

long distances and are relying on buses

subways to get around

the second reason is climate change we

are a city being more crowded we have

more traffic congestion and gridlock and

the emissions create even more health

problems we all need to breathe and

congestion pricing will create cleaner

and healthier air for us all thank you

thank you

===

hi

um one moment

oh

um

i've gotta talk fast sorry

um i didn't realize that my um script

was gonna disappear when

um

oh here we go my name is julie

huntington and i'm a queen's resident

and a member of families for safe

streets

i'm here to speak to the urgent need for

congestion pricing in new york city

because i know it will reduce

crash-related deaths and injuries

a 2018 study by the tri-state

transportation committee indicates that

congestion pricing can reduce the number

of traffic deaths in new york city by 71

and traffic injuries by 17 000 in the

first two years of its implementation

what are we waiting for

traffic violence is a public health

crisis

everyone thinks that they're immune that

it will never happen to them until one

day it does

i'm still reeling from the heartbreak of

losing my data traffic violence in 2019

i live with the pain of his sudden

violent and senseless death every day

here in new york city we have the chance

to lead the way to prevent injuries and

deaths by implementing simple

cost-effective life-saving solutions

and we have the chance to do this by

taking action now

it is also too late for my friend bob

bowen who was killed by a hit and run

driver while riding his bike down 2nd

avenue in the manhattan central business

district in 2010

two minutes doesn't give me enough time

to tell you about bob about my dad or

about the more than

1 800 people who have been killed by

traffic violence in new york city since

mayor de blasio took office in 2014.

the devastation of each life loss is

cataclysmic

and incalculable

we know what we need to do to protect

and preserve human lives on the streets

and sidewalks of new york city this

one's a no-brainer it's time to follow

the data and implement congestion

pricing now with minimal exceptions and

without delay

thank you

===

hi can you hear me

yes okay um hi my name is yuda i am from

queens

um i

walk across a on-ramp to the grand

central parkway every day to get to the

train

um it is often an unrelenting flood of

cars i think congestion pricing

will

slow down the amount of cars

that is easier to crawl safely because

they do not yield pedestrians

um

it will also uh free up cars

in central business districts so that

people will be able to safer from

vehicle traffic

in manhattan

um

it'll also reduce

reduce bus travel times so that people

get to

get around faster

by bus

um

and it is also it's also very useful for

uh for for

for deliveries drivers to

get around so that people actually know

when uh things are coming there are a

lot of time sensitive things being

delivered around new york um i recently

worked

as an intern with a

general contractor on construction site

and um concrete trucks

especially um are very time sensitive

and being able to know when things are

coming saves everyone a lot of time and

the fewer exemptions there are for

different um types of people the fewer

cars there will be more dependable um

our cities um delivery

system is able to be

and i think the uh funds that we

generate from congestion pricing can

easily be used to

help

improve transit in places like eastern

europeans where i live where there is

not a lot of very good

um so that's it

thank you

thank you

===

uh there we go

can you see me

yes we can see i hear you okay i don't

see you but okay all right uh this is

richard fazomi i'm with the old astoria

neighborhood association

and our astoria neighborhood and western

queens in general stands to be greatly

affected uh by congestion pricing

because some may choose to park their

vehicles in our neighborhood and take

public transit to and from manhattan

as a general matter we are not opposed

to congestion pricing to control traffic

in manhattan and to get extra revenue

however provisions must be made so that

the borough's quality of life is not

negatively affected

also extremely important those who hold

new york city disability parking permits

must be exempt from these fees

as by the nature of disabilities they do

not have a choice to take public

transportation and lastly local business

that utilizes commercial vehicles in the

course of their business

must either be exempt or pay a flat fee

even if they do have multiple trips

thank you

thank you

===
i can hear me

yes

and now you should be able to see me

also

um hi my name is max i live in brooklyn

uh on the border between prospect and

crown heights i'm here today to support

congestion pricing

um i think we need to get this done

quickly

and as widespread as possible

uh cars are very inefficient way to

navigate the largest and probably

densest city in the united states um and

we need to encourage people to get on

bikes on public transit buses subways

ferries etc

cars just take up a lot of space they're

dangerous they contribute to uh

hundreds of deaths in terms of crashes

as well as pollution

we in new york are going to have a lot

of uh the population who now is

suffering from various long-term

uh coveted symptoms which will interact

with the pollution um to cause various

respiratory ailments um additionally

the entire time i've been alive i've

been hearing about climate the climate

crisis um yet we act in this incredibly

slow and ineffective way

we need to take decisive and quick

action to reduce the amount of driving

to reduce greenhouse gases and to reduce

pollution um the fact that this process

has taken years and years and promises

to take years more um is really an

embarrassment and

quite frankly

is very upsetting to me

as someone who i think is younger than

probably a lot of the people who call

into these meetings um

that we're being left with an earth that

is warmer that is more polluted

additionally

congestion pricing will decrease traffic

and help promote

funding the mta to improve service thank

you

thank you

===

hello my name is yvette vasquez

and i live in park chester in the bronx

and i am a

woman of color and a frontline worker

and i'm here to support the congestion

pricing because the outer boroughs

desperately need

more investment in their transit system

as kovid was able to magnify the need

where frontline workers relied heavily

on transportation to and from their jobs

and

especially in the south bronx where we

already know that the environmental

impact of

cars and congestion has caused high

asthma rates

some of the highest in the country

if we include some more bus ways and

expand on select bus service this will

help cut down in transportation time for

those workers who need to get to

manhattan as well as improve the

environment for those of us who live in

the bronx and help for our future

generations so that they don't have such

high asthma rates

and that's all thank you

thank you

===

gerard yes hello can you hear me

yes

yes

um good evening my name is dr demers and

i am a front line worker who works with

children with developmental disabilities

public transportation is my primary way

of traveling including to and from my

place of employment

i live in co-op city in the northeast

bronx

co-op city is a large community of

primarily working and middle class

people many of whom rely on public

transportation

within co-op city is a large community

of older people and people with

disabilities

who rely on public transportation

to do shopping get to medical

appointments etc

co-op city is not within walking

distance to a subway station so bus

service is essential to access the

subway system

approximately a year and a half to two

years ago we were facing a significant

cut to our bus service

which we were thankfully able to mostly

hurt

however bus service especially at night

and during the weekends is boston's

unreliable

i strongly urge the implementation

congestion pricing to maintain and

hopefully improve a public

transportation system and we also

advocate that revenue gain for

congestion pricing goes to maintaining

an improvement transportation system

public transportation is an essential

service for many of us who own the ship

of a vehicle is not a realistic option

also we would hopefully have the added

benefit a positive effect on the

environment by increasing the use of

public transportation and reducing the

use of private vehicles thank you for

providing me the opportunity to speak

about this important issue

thank you

===

hello my name is elizabeth denis and i

live in flatbush in brooklyn i'm here to

speak to the need to implement

congestion pricing as quickly as

possible with as few exemptions as

possible

i like the vast majority of new yorkers

walk bike and take public transit to get

around the city driving into manhattan

is not a necessity it's a choice made by

a minority of new yorkers that

negatively affects everyone

car traffic slows our buses down and

sometimes even grinds them to a halt the

western section of the m21 bus is

suspended almost every single day due to

traffic congestion entering the hull and

tunnel and it's unacceptable that public

transit can't operate because there are

too many cars

congestion also endangers cyclists lives

because it leads to drivers driving

through and idling in bike lanes i don't

bike as much as i'd like to including in

downtown and midtown manhattan because i

feel unsafe on the city's congested

streets

congestion puts pedestrians at risk too

because crosswalks are often blocked

2021 has already been a record-breaking

year for traffic violence and reducing

the number of cars on the road would

save lives

cars increase air pollution in our city

which disproportionately affects lower

income communities and communities of

color and those same communities would

benefit the most from revenue from

congestion pricing going towards public

transit options

we need congestion pricing now to ensure

there is in new york city for decades to

come cbd tolling will directly fund

necessary and overdue public transit

maintenance and so that it can run

smoothly and with less interruption

instead of further falling into

disrepair

we also need to have congestion pricing

because we need to incentivize new

yorkers to choose greener modes of

transportation because catastrophic

climate events are already here

fortunately car owners tend to be

wealthier new yorkers the cost of owning

a car is substantial and they can afford

to finally start to pay their fair share

i urge the mta to implement congestion

pricing as quickly as possible and

consider no additional exemptions from

the tolling scheme to keep it simple and

fair and to maximize the positive change

it can bring to our city now and for

decades to come thank you

thank you

===

hello do you hear me

yes okay fantastic

i don't see

[Music]

where to start my video there i go okay

uh thank you everyone for calling in and

sharing your thoughts my name is carlos

born and i live in bed stuy

i'm here to say quite simply that i

request that if congestion pricing goes

into effect it only applies during peak

hours during off-peak hours the

citizenry and small businesses should be

able to go into the city without a toll

otherwise families such as mine and

businesses will be heard i'll give you

one example

during the pandemic my family and i

wanted krispy kreme donuts that were

free if we got vaccinated so after

getting vaccinated we drove down to the

only krispy kreme in town that happens

to be downtown however if there would

have been a toll then we would not have

gone to get our free donut for getting

vaccinated we would have missed out on

the delicious krispy kreme donuts

krispy kreme would have missed out on

the foot traffic that they desire and

the city would have had less effective

vaccination campaign as a result

so please

only put congestion pricing during peak

traffic hours thank you

thank you

===

can you hear me

yes

great okay

my name is john walter i'm a resident of

flatbush brooklyn

uh the congestion pricing it's a it's a

reasonable concept but the notion that

lower manhattan is where the worst

congestion is is totally flawed

i mean that's a fantasy that could have

only been dreamed up by someone who

never leaves manhattan

the long island expressway is a crawl

until you get to the midtown tunnel and

then once you get into manhattan the

streets are pretty easy to drive on

all the other highways the bqe the cross

bronx they're all parking lots during

the day and the local streets are

crammed too so manhattan is not where

the traffic problems are but if you keep

people out of manhattan it's going to

make traffic and emissions worse

everywhere else and i'd be really

shocked if your study

found otherwise

this would not survive a public

referendum it's no surprise it's been

shot down year after year until in a

stroke of brilliant salesmanship our

former governor decided to market this

as a money source to fix the subway

this is manhattan-centric ivory tower

thinking at its worst

elitist might be an overused word but it

seems to apply here since the burden is

being placed on working people in the

other boroughs

and you know for a bunch of smart people

you're ignoring the lessons of history

not to mention economics 101 that uh by

thinking that you know government

central planning can allocate scarce

resources better than market forces

that's it

===

there hello i'm here

yep yes this is zaya baptiste i'm a

lifelong resident of brooklyn and first

i would like to address how the mta and

the other advocacy groups reached out to

the constituency to speak on this topic

the usual under-rep community is not

here this is filled with groups who

spent six figures to make sure that

their supporters are present aware and

vocally supportive of their goal and

most companies in support stand to make

revenue the lift lime ride shares and

advocacy groups that receive financial

support so as i reached out to community

organizations i found that very few were

aware of these hearings

how a real representative

to become a part of this uh long-term

conversation should be addressed and i

understand the concerns for congestion

pricing i'm not totally against it but

all of this should not be dumped on

drivers street closings narrowing of

lanes restaurant seating ride sharing a

continuous boom and construction have

had the most significant impact on

congestion i've heard quality of life is

an issue and the public transit system

does not offer improved quality of life

of life you could just ask the the

writers and the employees this talk of

driver aggression is not to be

attributed to drivers but society as a

whole and there is also an uptick in

bicyclists pedestrian accidents and

fatalities so it's something to be

wholly addressed and not creating an

atmosphere that is aggressive and biased

just because someone has a car the nba

the mta can't handle an influx of riders

now

what are they going to do when all of

these people come back to to mass

transit also the wealthiest sector of

people live in the sub 60th street area

the political influence gets them that

tax but the proposal would allow them to

be exempt yet the goal is to tax all

vehicles because every vehicle on the

road by theory contributes to congestion

so is this really about congestion

environment or privilege and money um we

need some new leadership at the mta

that's really what what needs to happen

thank you

===

hi

hi my name is bill bruno queens resident

for 35 years

two key aspects first cars and trucks

are one of the major drivers of

greenhouse gases the epa has found that

the transportation sector is now the

largest contributor and more than half

of that comes from passenger cars medium

and heavy-duty trucks suvs pickup trucks

and minivans

anything disincentivizes their use and

drives people to mass transit offsets

that the recent storm events we've had

which are just a harbinger of things to

come indicates the urgency of doing this

i tend to concur with prior statements

that 26 months seems too long for this

there's an equity angle as well right

now car owners who generate traffic

congestions environmental and traffic

delay costs are passing those to society

at large ingestion pricing would place

some of that back on the activity that

causes these problems

equity also caused for shifting of

resources from cars to mass transit as

in our non-car owners who have to use

mass transit are on average less

well-off than car owners in fact more

workers can meet by mass transit than by

cars

fine congestion also harms transit users

in that delay's bus service for example

the m21 bus has had its rush hour

service suspended on a regular basis at

its last few stops for the last several

weeks because of car traffic at the

holland tunnel

the other equity aspects that carve out

should be minimized every carve out

increases the burden on those people who

have to pay a higher toll every carvel

reduces the income from this plan

and the money is key a report uh from

reinvent albany says the mta does not

yet have enough money to finance its

capital program a program essential to

making more stations ada accessible and

improving transit timeliness

thank you for your time and for this

this session

===

hello

hi

pleasure in your remarks yes i'm elias

i'm a prize citizen and i am from

brooklyn so i am against the program

first in my belief increasing tolls

won't reduce congestion uh because those

who are forced to travel to lower

manhattan every day will still uh travel

regardless of tolls second this program

won't decrease the emissions

because same amount of cars will travel

daily rather congestion will be caused

in other parts of the city where you

don't have to pay tolls such as brooklyn

bridge as an example as opposed to hula

tunnel where you have to pay

third this program is in violation of

fundamental right to travel guaranteed

by

liberty quotes

incorporated by 5th and 14th amendment

of u.s constitution and article 1 of u.s

constitution mta is trying to infringe

on the on this right by forcing people

to pay tolls and i will sue mta on this

just like i sued the mayor de blasio

over the vaccine mandate executive order

225 in the eastern district of new york

um

fourth mta will also create unequal

classes between those who pay full tolls

prices and those who are exempt this is

violation of 14th amendment uh equal

protection clause and article one of new

york state constitution which also has

equal protection clause

six

i mean fifth the prices for uber and

lyft will increase okay

um

six um

uh there will be unequal uh

representation because not everybody

knows about this public hearing and

finally the seventh mta is acting bad

faith uh by imposing

tools to compensate for deficit in this

budget due to waste and mismanagement i

think office of new york state attorney

general should investigate mta for waste

and mismanagement rather than trump

organization that is all i have thank

you

===

um hi my name is scott rising i'm a

resident of queens

new york and i'm here to tell you that

we are already paying for congestion

pricing we are paying for it in our air

quality we are paying for it in traffic

fatalities we are paying for it in

slower ambulances and we are paying for

it in climate change which is urgent and

it is coming

we need to do everything that we can to

urgently pass congestion pricing so the

people who are causing the impact are

the ones paying for it i say this as a

car owner

i think that some of that money could be

used to increase buses and maybe get

buses a pr campaign because buses are

great

and they are

a

very efficient and wonderful way for

people to get around

the city and

i think that there should be as few

exemptions as possible the more

exemptions you make the less

successful

that this program will be that means no

police officers that means no residents

of midtown and in terms of motorcyclists

i think there needs to be a different uh

way to do this where zero emissions

motorcyclists

pay no

you know suggestion there are exceptions

for them but if they are admitting that

they will eventually down the line pay

a toll to incentivize people to do zero

emission

cycling um but this is urgent and

we should enact this as soon as possible

thank you

===

hi good evening um my name is tiffany

fields and i've lived in all five

boroughs

um and traffic has always been a problem

so if you increase tolls and apply taxes

how is it going to stop people from

traveling

when trains are congested buses are

limited in all boroughs i live in

brooklyn and i can't find a bus to even

get me to the bronx

it has been

four days since i even touched a train

because i was afraid of how crowded it

would be

on the trains after

us going through covet and i was afraid

of even traveling because it's always

crowded yes i am 35 years old and this

is my first time even receiving a permit

because i wanted to get a car so that

way i can avoid getting on the train

avoid being on pack buses um i feel as

though whatever resources is going to be

implemented after this um conference we

need to apply more services into our

communities and apply more

express buses to be able to help people

get around but if we even have express

buses you still have blockages from

construction and and um blockages from

roadsides and um

so many different stipulations that

still will cause traffic i feel as

though it's not about raising the price

or putting stipulations on people from

traveling we need to get better services

so people can trust the services thank

you

===
hi can you hear me okay

so i want to start over again i'm a

queen's resident and i use a mobilized

wheelchair full-time i am against

congestion pricing because this place is

an undue burden on people with

disabilities we all know here that the

mta is not fully accessible and

accessoried it's a joke

at times due to the fact that the curb

cuts in queens have not been plowed for

days i do require transportation to my

employer

on using my accessible car i have family

members who will drop me off and pick me

up this means that if it is twenty three

dollars i will have to pay twenty three

dollars both ways to get to and from the

city

i also think is discriminatory against

other residents from the other boroughs

let's say that you have your undergoing

chemotherapy you would then have to pay

money to get to a manhattan hospital

such as sloan kettering but if you live

in manhattan and can't use public

transportation you are free to rent a

vehicle use an uber and you won't have

to pay as much i'm completely against

this and i do sincerely feel that if you

end up passing this then you should

require people who live in manhattan and

rent own or lease vehicles should pay a

monthly fee if you're going to go ahead

and make the rest of us pay fees as well

i think if you do plan to make

exceptions

for um you know people with disabilities

it shouldn't be just when they're in the

vehicles but when people are coming to

pick them up

wow thank you

===

can you hear me

yes

oh uh good evening i'm sal albanese

thank you for allowing the public uh to

provide you feedback on this important

issue throughout the years as a former

elected officials i've talked about

congestion pricing i understand the

concept behind it taking cars off the

road and improving our environment as a

state islander i want to continue to

stress the importance of toll equity

staten islanders are disproportionately

impacted by excessive totals and

congestion pricing is no exception

congestion pricing will

disproportionately impact state

landlords who commute to the city by car

given the more limited public

transportation options available in the

borough and the bridging tunnels

throughout the commute i'm especially

concerned for our essential workers many

essential workers including firefighters

police officers doctors and nurses

commute at all hours to manhattan on

their shifts

our essential workers have gone through

a lot over the last year and a half

let's not make things more difficult for

them i continue to support an

alternative which i've proposed in the

play in the past i support a plan in

which staten islanders who commute over

the verrazano bridge and through you

carry tunnel are not told additionally

when entering the central business

district zone as a matter of fact mayor

bloomberg's proposal called for just

that an offset for staten islanders and

sam schwartz's plan also calls for an

offset at mylanders uh

so i i think that's that's an indication

of fairness we the staten islands

continue to pay some of the highest

tolls in this in the nation the

congestion pricing plan must include a

mechanism by which staten island

residents commuting to work are not

forced to pay more

than their fair share

thank you and good evening

===

hello

can you hear me now

hello

yes are you able to hear me

yes we are

okay great great okay

so i'll repeat my comment uh there were

two things that i had concerned about uh

the responsibility or the burden of the

charges

of

the

um

tunnels and delivery trucks that they

bring in that area

and

there is an undue hardship for those who

actually have an income of 60 000 or or

less

and um also there would be an issue with

uh businesses who would uh have to um

take upon the burden

also secondly um it seems that you're

focused on the 60th street and below

and basically it's not expanded to the

five different boroughs so i see a lot

of congestion

all over and as well as in the bronx

and all the other parts of the boroughs

there is congestion the air quality is

poor

and um the l.i.e highway is

impacted as well

and

central park grand central parkway both

north and south

and jfk area is highly congested and so

that should not be just for the 60th

street and under it should be in all its

entirety so that way it would be better

managed and thirdly um i had a concern

about the

uh

listening to the five different boroughs

the air quality has been impacting us

the quality of life

has been reduced i encourage that you

would focus on the other five boroughs

as well thank you very much

===

hello my on

yes we can hear you

okay great hello everyone i'm from

staten island

um staten islanders we get hit no matter

what direction we're going just to get

off the island

so they get hit again once we get into

manhattan is just cruel and mean

it's like taxation after taxation after

taxation it's completely

unconstitutional

to be taxing our travel as we have a

right to travel

wherever we want on any public property

on any public street

you cannot stop us and you cannot charge

us and you cannot ask us for our papers

by the way like you've been doing lately

so everyone be blessed visit

politicalmoron.com

and remember that criminals always wind

up in jail have a great night

===

hi everyone

i'm an eight-year resident of clinton

hill brooklyn and i've been living in

brooklyn for 16 years i'm a biker and

the mother of a toddler who walks to

preschool every day

due to increased car commuting since the

pandemic the streets of our neighborhood

are more congested and filled with more

reckless drivers than ever before

community

district 2 already has one of the

highest rates of childhood asthma in new

york city even though the majority of

the residents in our neighborhood do not

own cars i strongly support congestion

pricing and want to urge the mta to

reduce the 16-month environmental

assessment process and implement

congestion pricing with as few

exceptions as possible as soon as

possible

we've already been waiting too long for

congestion pricing to go into effect the

mta needs the revenue to improve its

infrastructure and make subway and bus

improvements that will benefit all new

yorkers for brooklynites congestion

pricing will reduce the number of cars

driving through brooklyn to cross the

manhattan brooklyn and williamsburg

bridges and make our streets safer for

pedestrians and bikers

thank you

===

hi uh can you hear me

yes yeah hi my name is michael streeter

i'm a brooklyn resident

uh i want to speak in favor of

congestion pricing and against any

exemptions

the way our city treats bus riders is is

unacceptable

our our buses ride at a snail's pace

there's

very very limited service

our bus riders are the most disrespected

spit-on citizens and how car drivers are

given priority over a a busload of

people

is uh it's simply a travesty that needs

to be remedied

as soon as possible and uh funds need to

be used to

improve

bus and subway service

i also want to make it very clear there

should be no exemptions

and definitely not for the nypd

we pay the members of the nypd

and many other city agencies very very

well

they have very lucrative careers if they

want to drive in into manhattan for

their work they can pay

they and many other city employees and

others

who are demanding except exemptions uh

they already have placards which allow

them to park pretty much wherever they

want

which has been a a major contributor to

congestion to begin with

these privileges have been abused long

enough and we do not need to give these

highly corrupt parties additional

discounts thank you for your time

===

hi can you hear me

yes

all right so

let's go ahead and get started so

i'm mostly here to explain the

ramifications the mta either has failed

or refused to observe and care about the

people who can afford to pay any of

these fees live near the subway are

walking distance from where they work

most people till they buy a car not for

convenience but necessity the mca has

failed on many aspects of necessity

as a service provider it's another

subject but moving on

bottom line is those new yorkers who

need a car from necessities will be

impacted the most

potential money given back later in tax

credits will not soften the blow of

upfront financial costs

another effect that this will induce is

drastic action that residents feel that

they need to take

this can be anything from trying to

simply relocate as part of the ongoing

exodus that was caused by the pandemic

i'm not here to scrutinize the mca

primarily i believe

my time would be better spent explaining

that fish could swim in water or that

the sky is generally blue it's a shed

light on what else seems to be ignored

that can be a viable solution

over a year later people still don't

know how to wear a mask

a baby knows how to roll over in a year

can't cancel up

i find it hard to believe that we can't

move any further

find them

people double park in

express bus lanes find them

just like

just a simple spot check on the chain on

the train

there is another fine

it's not fair that us that have to pay

in a hefty price on insurance that have

to pay for gas that has to pay for all

these factors have to now go ahead and

be even more financially oppressed

keeping this continuing pattern always

going to open up a few of being able to

go to another state where revenue will

be shared or being always covered your

remarks hang up

all right thank you ===

here

we can

um good evening uh everyone my name is

aziz i'm a for hire vehicle driver and

uh the organizing director of the

independent driver's guild the idg

thanks for the opportunity uh to testify

before you today regarding the central

business district towing program

the idg is a non-profit affiliate of the

machinist union and our organization

represents over 120 000 drivers across

new york state

i'm here to caution you to employ you

not to add any additional fees on trips

in for hire vehicles including uber lyft

delivery and taxis i am asking for a

hundred percent exemption

all drivers were struggling and barely

able to make ends meet before the

pandemic and we have been through some

even tougher time over the last 18

months and counting

while companies like amazon tribe in a

pandemic for higher vehicle drivers were

suddenly without work

but were still on the hook for

contractual expenses for vehicle payment

and trc insurance which often can total

up to more than a thousand dollars from

one

and that's before renting food to date

fhv trips are still significantly lower

than during the pre-pandemic period

that being said

we simply cannot absorb another fee or

another tax

even if it's paid for by the rider the

ultimate impact will be on the driver in

lost business and income

for higher vehicle driver

for higher vehicle travel in new york

city cannot be seen as an untapped

source of funding for the state city or

mta this must stop because it's the only

as it only hurt the working-class poor

immigrant communities and drivers for

hire vehicle

ride already paid

more than their fair share we have been

subjected to the congestion fees since

2019

where has that money go on how much been

mta has been raising uh has raised on

the congestion program

while we are

we share the all-important goal of

reducing

traffic improving air quality and these

conclude your remarks

instead of increasing costs on these

drivers or those riders who depend on

these services for reliable

transportation we

look on other contributions thank you

===
hi

can you hear me yes

okay wonderful

um my name is katie hart i live in bay

ridge brooklyn and i am a parent of a

child with special needs

my child attends a specialized school on

the upper west side in manhattan in

order to receive his fair and

appropriate education for his learning

disabilities

the commute on a bus or public

transportation with multiple transfers

is far too long for my six-year-old

so which with much sacrifice to my

family i drive him every day so that

he'll be ready to learn at the start of

school

and when i pick him up in the afternoon

it allows me to take him to his his

additional therapies

that are necessary

we've talked there's been talk about

exemptions

for people with disabilities i'm

wondering

will this include children like mine who

has learning disabilities that travel

from outer boroughs into manhattan in

order to receive their fair and

appropriate education

and when exactly will a waiver process

or exemption process be made public so

that my family may apply

who will be the point of contact thank

you for giving me this opportunity to

speak today

===

hello can you hear me

yes we can okay hi

um i am actually an app-based driver and

i also um an advocate for the drivers i

oppose this congestion 100

i believe that drivers should be exempt

we travel across the bridges many

different times

per day transporting riders this will be

a burden on the drivers

we have

we are drivers paying mt already two

surcharges

versus 275 plus 3.75

on every ride

why should we then again come and pay

another fee to mta mta has not shown us

drivers fhv drivers

any exemptions we cannot use the lanes

we cannot use the bike lanes to drop to

to if there's only option we can't even

pull up to the sidewalk to drop off our

passengers the riders are paying to be

able to be on the road on mtva so charge

but getting zero benefits

we're asking

that if this

plan goes in that our drivers are held

exempt we are disproportionately

immigrant

we

actually

fall under your rule

as of

minority for justice

um for the immigrants and

environmental justice for minorities we

need to be exempt

we cannot afford to give any mta any

more money and the right is cannot

afford this unjust fear we need uh the

writers to be able to have a real say on

what happens in this please make us

exempt we already are paying a huge fee

thank you

===

all

right um so yes so uh my name is jackie

i'm actually part of the independent

driver skills so

what i want to say is that drivers in

the fhv industry should be exempted from

congestion pricing uh and the reason why

i say that is because you know if you

want any

uh if you want any congestion pricing

money i think you should be targeting

the app companies right the app

companies they have the resources not

the drivers that have these kind of

resources uh available to pay for these

uh and not only that you know who are

the ones that are requesting the rides

in these areas and that would be the

writers so you know as a matter of fact

fhv cars those that drive for uber and

lyft we are already paying these um the

congestion pricing uh you know anywhere

below i believe 96th street they are

paying 275 on top of the fare uh which

is something that is just the mta like a

regular subway ride um

and

not only that but also new york city tlc

real estate that you cannot overcharge a

customer right so you know being that it

was always being congested

riders are always being overcharged but

that is not the driver's fault uh you

know we should be able to have an easier

way for drivers to send the passengers

to where they have to go uh you know on

the left side of manhattan there's

always on each street right there's

always a bike lane on the right side

sometimes it's one lane sometimes it's

two lanes and those are bustling and

those bus lanes they take up a lot of

space are they always being utilized no

i'm not saying hey don't give these bus

things priority but let us use it too

that would that way we could get our

writers there much faster uh and also if

you were to exempt anybody uh you know

like or or like you know or someone to

to to go after

cyclists and and and motorcyclists right

the reason why i say that is because

they are danger to the road they don't

follow the rules of the road and that is

against vision zero please conclude your

remarks zero is something that we want

to push for for the safety of everybody

right everybody have to follow the rules

and last but not least before i finish

you know i believe that we should have

===

all right so i think everybody can hear

me right now yes we can

all right excellent i've hear i've heard

a lot of uh

commentary here talking about congestion

and the reality of things is that only

minority being attacked and only

minority being targeted uh in this model

uh or in this haunting program

i've been a driver for over 17 years uh

and when i drove a yellow cab before and

i was paying the mta and i heard that i

was paying the mt i understand why i was

paying the mta yeah fixing the

infrastructure i'm also a user of

of of the mta services

uh which sometimes or most of the time

we're not reliable however

coming to

creating this model right here and

having

people like me a driver that rely on

every penny uh not not to mention the

laws that we have every day

uh either getting targeted by the nypd

or the tlc fines that's another

financial burden that the drivers have

to carry i'm sorry i didn't mention my

um my name but my name is larvae taboo

i'm a

driver here in new york city

and also an advocate for all the drivers

community taxi drivers

black hard drivers

one thing that i just want to mention

right here that this program

will

puts people uh lives in jeopardy and it

will hurts a lot of drivers pocket think

about it uh reform it and exempt the

drivers completely from the stalling

because they are what they are the one

that moves new york city uh they are one

that moves the essential workers doctors

lawyers uh uh nurses uh during the

pandemic who was carrying all these

people the taxi drivers the fhv drivers

the one that were

carrying these people not the mta uh and

and i thank you for the time thank you

===

hello

we can hear you okay sorry i took a

minute uh good evening my name is lucy

coaching and i have a few points to make

i i do oppose the congestion pricing

plan the people who will be hurt the

most are the working class people who

have no choice but to take a car into

the area many other workers who have to

carry tools and equipment to do their

job

and essential workers who work out hours

to to create the idea that one part of

the city is more precious than other

parts of the city and that we have to

pay extra to enter there with a car but

not into other areas manhattan becomes

the shiny city on the hill and we have

to pay to enter

if you live in the pricing area and use

a car you have to pay an extra tax just

to return to your home

four they're more equitable ways to

raise money such as by taxing the

wealthy such as an increase in capital

gains and money made in the stock market

which is not earned money

and dedicated to the mta how about

asking jeff bezos to give back a couple

of billion that he made off of new

yorkers and for clogging our streets

with amazon trucks and amazon garbage

seriously

he will make it back in an hour or two

and the other billionaires like

bloomberg who made billions off of new

york city residents

charging 23 to 35 dollars is an

outrageous amount of money and

businesses will pass these costs onto

the customers who already the tax payers

that keep the city going

people who drive from from the outer

boroughs often have no choice but to

drive due to lack of public

transportation near to them or because

they have a disability that does not

allow for them to take public

transportation

the subways are not available to many

people unable to manage stairs

and will hurt tourist

areas like chinatown and broadway shows

and other entertainment venues people

drive in from outside the city and are

fearful to take public transportations

many of the hospitals and doctors

offices are below 60 street and people

often need to be driven to appointments

or to the hospital could you remember

these can be multiple trips it is not a

choice they have and one other thing

um

the city

===

so my name is mohamed osan

i'm an immigrant from bangladesh um

working in new york city since 2015

as a fsb driver started my career with i

saw them every single step is a the fsb

driver are negligent and the sufferer

so as a

worker as a

um

like

what can i say like uh okay

like as a driver i realized that

everything is a pressurized to the fsb

driver all thing i'd go to against to

the drivers so i'm totally um against to

this congressional surprise i'm

representing to the driver's cooperative

i'm also the member of the driver's

cooperative so

my view is

the

planner please

think about

the other way don't think to pressurize

the hundred thousand drivers family is a

new york city is a four five hundred

years ago the same way the millionaire

people are increasing what you do think

about how can you make a double roots

overpass make a new rules that is not

the duty to in uh planning every day to

the searchers i'm suggesting to the

everyone

lord the tools five dollar in a time

like the manhattan queen speed like and

10 for the other big bridges you know

the tunnels so that is the my proposal

and i'm requesting to the panelists

everyone uh don't think about the

increase the price increase those

or business people those are million

billion dollars not think about the

simple taxi drivers so i think so the

panelists will think about that the

planner will think about that uh to make

because um my other folks are also

mentioned we keep new york city alive in

the pandemic types no other than so

think about the taxi driver 100 000

family members and thank you everyone

for listening to me thanks again

===

hello can you hear me yes we can

okay hold on i just need to minimize my

screen all right

good evening everyone uh my name is

daniel solo and i'm calling from parker

towers in forest hills queens

i'm calling me tonight to express my

full support for the central business

district tolling program also known as

congestion pricing

with hurricane ida in the rear view

mirror and a summer that we've

experienced oppressive heat we need to

be really serious about the threat of

climate change and the repercussions of

our municipal and personal

transportation decisions

we cannot wait a full year and a half

for statistical models and experts to

tell us what we already know

our love affair with cars is killing us

thanks to the leadership of our activist

community and forward-thinking

politicians new york has become a much

safer place for my wife and i to

navigate city streets on foot fight and

public transportation

i don't need a car to do most things and

most new yorkers don't even own cars

however our subway is failing us today

much of the subway signal technology is

over 90 years old and the sun that

tunnels rehabilitation

delays are costing us time and money

all the repairs so millions of new

yorkers rely on the subway every day

including those on the front lines who

are fighting for us in this pandemic

the subway is what makes new york so

special and it deserves these capital

investments that will help us compete

with other metropolitan areas

in closing implementing congestion

pricing is good for our lungs our most

vulnerable new yorkers

and frankly other cities are looking at

us to take the first step

across the pond

london and

other cities in europe have shown

decreases in air pollution and improves

transit speeds

new york will show the rest of north

america that we are serious about

tackling climate change please conclude

your remarks thank you very much have a

good evening

===
roberta if you unmute yourself you can

begin your remarks

my name is roberta cooperman and i

represent people with physical

challenges i agree with the concept that

people should be encouraged to take mass

transit which is better for the

environment

you state that this tax won't

apply to people with disabilities

however i will give you three scenarios

in which taping taking public

transportation is impossible and this

fee absolutely discriminates against

group of people groups of people with

either temporary physical challenges or

visitors to new york with physical

challenges one i am 69 years old retired

and broke my tibia i do not have a

handicap permit for my car it takes

months to receive one my doctor's

appointments are in manhattan it is just

wrong that i would have to incur a 23

tax to see my doctor

two i just finished 15 months of

chemotherapy my treatments were in

manhattan during this time my husband

needed two surgeries in manhattan people

had to drive us again no one has

handicapped permits we are sick and

barely have energy to do minimal tasks

three my 93 year old mother would visit

from florida i always like to take her

to visit manhattan she has a handicapped

permit in florida since she has a heart

condition she needs to get dropped off

close to her destination why are you

penalizing her for her age and her

handicap

during the bottom line there are many

reasons why people who would prefer to

use mass transit and not deal with

traffic and help the environment are

just not physically able to

you need to figure out a way

to address the above population in an

equitable

non-discriminatory manner i believe it's

healthy people who write these laws

without a clue about the impact on

people with physical challenges we need

to be taken into account one day this

might be you

===

hi everybody it's a little dark where i

am here so i'm gonna keep my camera off

um my name is sebastian i'm a resident

of brooklyn

um

i don't think it's a surprise that

everyone here as opposed to

congestion

and pollution

and traffic and global warming of course

we're all opposed to all of these things

what we need to keep an eye on here is

where is this money going

where is this money going this new money

this new taxes fee

and if the past is any guide

all we have to do is look at the new

york times article

uh december 28 2017

entitled the most expensive mile of

track on earth

this article uh documents the fact that

equivalent infrastructure in new york

costs five times as much to build as it

does in los angeles

london or paris and that's because the

mta consistently with this capital

improvement budget

spends 80 cents of every dollar on waste

fraud and abuse and gives us only 20

cents worth of value for every dollar we

spend

and there's no indication in anything

that's been spoken about this plan that

this is going to be any different

so the question on the

table right now is really absurd the

question is how much more waste fraud

and abuse would you like to pay for

would you like a 25 waste fraud abuse

charge or a 10 waste fraud abuse charge

it's absolutely absurd until the mta is

able to patch this giant hole in the

bottom of its bucket its monetary bucket

it doesn't make any more sense to put

any more money into this bucket it's a

waste of new yorkers hard-earned money

and new york is never going to have the

infrastructure it deserves as long as

the mta continues to waste 80

of its capital budget

all right thanks everyone

===

can you hear me

yes we can

great my name is zach miller i am a

lifelong queens resident and proud

member of the trucking industry when

kovan 19 was at its worst trucking was

at its best keeping our economy moving

forward every day by safely ensuring

grocery shelves were stocked hospital

and farmers were supplied and businesses

were able to stay afloat as working

consumer needs shifted overnight and how

does new york city look to thank this

industry for their heroic work by taxing

them of course this is curious for a few

reasons firstly because trucks make

deliveries based on consumer and

business demand not because they want to

cruise around midtown manhattan for fun

there is no mass transit option i live

five minutes from the f train and i

assure you the f doesn't stand for

freight attacks to encourage mass

transit use is utterly irrelevant for

commercial freight secondly and this is

not directed at the mta but those who

support congestion pricing under notions

that trucks don't pay their fair share

are you kidding me at port authority

bridges and tolls trucks currently pay

up to 132 dollars depending on vehicle

size at the mta bridges and tunnels that

cost maxes out at about 79 dollars per

trip depending on size then there's new

york state's highway use tax then

there's the ifta international fuel tax

which is a portion based on miles

traveled within new york state and the

irp the international registration plan

of course there are fuel taxes collected

at each fill up much of that money is

supposed to be dedicated to improving

and maintaining highway infrastructure

but is regularly rated by our elected

officials for other programs in new york

city there's an actual vehicle tax which

imposes up to 300 annual fee on each

commercial vehicle and we can't forget

about the parking tickets which bring in

over half a billion dollars annually to

new york city as well as the absurdities

and citizen engine idling tickets that

only apply to commercial vehicles the

trucking industry in total pays about

1.2 billion in federal and state rugby

taxes truckers pay about 35 percent of

all taxes paid by new york motorists

even though trucks only drive about

seven percent of the total miles

traveled the typical five axle tracks

five axle tractor trailer pays over

twenty one thousand

user fees and taxes these figures are

above the general business fees paid in

new york charging trucks congestion fee

is insulting absurd and short-sighted

thank you

===

i can hear me yes

hi

um i want to speak on this issue from

two perspectives actually both as a

motorist from the outer boroughs and as

a commercial vehicle driver myself

now as a motorist i feel it's just

another unfair assault on the middle

class or just another way to charge us

for

the luxury of driving into new york city

the idea that local motorists are rich

elites is laughable there are many

motorists who need to have a car due to

the fact that more than half of the

neighborhoods in new york city are

transit deserts

it may take the mta another 100 years to

address this issue via your capital plan

now this congestion pricing plan puts no

money into roads or bridges and 100

percent of the revenue goes back into

the transit system so an outer borough

resident like myself who lives in the

bronx

must fund the transit system that i

cannot easily access

now speaking as someone who has

earned a living driving trucks in new

york

this congestion pricing plan is going to

put a strain on hard-working

middle-class new yorkers who have earned

their living in the industry

the average new york city truck driver

looks like myself and is a hard-working

taxpayer and we overwhelmingly come from

the black and latino communities

some of us even own our own trucks and

routes that we operate now the

unintended consequences of adding

additional charges to the transportation

industry will negatively impact our

communities

jobs

and the tight rope profit margins we

already operate within

now imagine as an industry we have

already been spending and spread thin

throughout the pandemic because as

frontline workers in transportation we

kept the supply chain going

i also don't see any of this money going

into improving transit development or

equity for our communities who board

disproportionate brunt of the impact

during the pandemic

if this plan goes into effect it's going

to have a ripple effect into the price

of everything increase any of the items

that gets delivered from a truck in that

zone and throughout the city

the industry can absorb another cost

from this benefit

um according to the meeting

according to this public meeting we

still don't know how the prices are

going to look for trucks who the board

members are making the decisions and if

we truly are going to benefit from

easing congestion thank you

===
good evening my name is bill shimler and

i am thoroughly in support of congestion

pricing

my first exposure to ex to this uh

arrangement was in singapore in the mid

1980s subsequent to that in the early

2000s i became familiar with it in

london

and in both instances it seems to me to

work very very successfully clearly the

uh case in singapore has been going on

for decades now and everyone there seems

to support it

so i'm delighted to see that new york

city is finally coming into the 21st

century in adopting mechanics

and pricing that will enhance our public

transportation and support everybody's

support thank you

===

hello

as the popular sound on tick tock goes

well well well if it isn't the

consequences of my own actions

we are here tonight due to decades of

mta mismanagement

mta mismanagement and corruption instead

of spending money on improving mass

transit mta neglected their duties and

used their budget as a piggy bank for

vanity projects for cuomo to cover up

for his deep-seated insecurities

stemming from his relationship with his

father but i

digress

we should build a city that is less

polluted by motor vehicles but in order

to do that we need to create a superior

alternative to get people out of their

cars we can't force people out with

tolls but sadly mta has backed itself

into a corner we need an alternative

that recognizes climate change as a

serious threat and seeks to move people

where they want to go efficiently

economically and in mass that means

subways buses and bikes there needs to

be an iron clad guarantee that this

total money will go towards improving

mass transit and not just enriching the

mta coffers at least when uber and lyft

blow billions of dollars they provide a

great service and a good price mta blows

billions and provides a sub-par

unreliable service it has to stop

we need to get serious about improving

transit because we face an environmental

crisis and it is also flat out

embarrassing to see these second-tier

cities around the world who have it

better than the best city on earth does

when it comes to mass transit i'm not

speaking against or in favor of the

tolls but rather

pointed out the obvious that if you want

less cars build cities based around

people that provides better alternatives

for transportation to cars please

consider this testimony as the official

statement of the brooklyn libertarian

party thank you

thank you

===
hi good evening everyone my name is

margaret

john

can you hear only hear me

yes we can

okay

i um

i am not in favor

i cuz i do believe that the mta can do

much better than what they're doing

increasing the congestive prices is not

for us

as a home care worker it does not look

good on our side you know i think i'm

speaking for all home care workers right

because we don't make a lot of money and

um for those of us who have to use to

driving to work

into these five different boroughs and

those of us who have to um go through

manhattan

it's a pain in the neck you know when

there is traffic so i do think and mta

can do much much better you know because

most of the money that is that mta made

is going into their administration

pocket thank you so much

===

can you hear me

yes we can thank you uh thank you for

inviting the public here okay my name is

charles sturkin i live in manhattan and

i live within the uh uh district that

you're trying to regulate so um just one

before i read my statement i'll

i'll be within the time frame

um i think your statistics are wrong

about the number of people who live

below 60th street

it might have been based on

2010 but 2020 there's about 60 000 more

in that slide you presented my statement

the mta congestion pricing plan should

adopt a rebate system for residents who

live below 60th street in manhattan who

will be unfairly burdened or should i

say taxed because they own a car

um

[Music]

the state legislature enacted a rebate

program in their budget adoption a few

years ago for queens residents who used

the cross brave bridge to traverse to

and from rockaway section of queens

stacey amato

alluded to that before in her

presentation the rationale at the time

was that no other residents in the city

get charged for moving around within

their own borough

this rationale is just as valid today

in this plan to charge manhattan

residents who own a car from moving

around their borough

all manhattan legislators voted for the

queen's rebate in their budget adoption

the six community boards that are mapped

below 60th street account for

approximately 40 percent of manhattan's

1.7 million residents based on the 2020

census according to the economic

development corporation

22 percent of manhattan households

own and drive cars the mtna mta needs to

rethink the plan

to impose an extra burden on those

manhattan communities and their

residents will be districts these

conclude your remarks disproportionately

paid for mta capital programs while mega

corporations like ups amazon fedex thank

you district without

===
hi can you hear me

yes

i am a native new yorker and i'm opposed

to the congestion pricing and i live in

manhattan while i want to see a

reduction in greenhouse gases placing a

toll on the populace is not necessary we

need to explore other ways to reduce

emissions without an additional cost on

the average person

mismanagement of funds by the mta even

though fares continue to increase while

services

have been reduced not to mention the

general lack of accessibility and public

transportation

calls into question the fact that we're

going to give this entity additional

funding

most of the people who drive and do not

live in new york city we have people who

come from other areas including

westchester and new jersey most new

yorkers use public transportation even

when they own a car unless they're going

to a doctor's appointment especially in

this area where there's no parking and

fees to park in a garage are exorbitant

this will add another cause to people

who are suffering illnesses and people

with disabilities only the rich are

going to be able to enjoy the benefits

of traveling via vehicles and the

exemption from paying the tax

thank you so

much thank you

===

hi

hello my name is anwar malik

from long island and i am regular out in

the city

how was it

okay so drivers with passengers barely

make a hundred dollars with a 12 hour

shift

and here mta is trying to get more money

out of them

drivers have made everyone rich except

themselves and i believe putting more

tolls on them is complete nonsense

the proposed plan

is what i call robin rideshare or a taxi

driver and still not giving them any

protection

drivers are dying out there getting shot

robbed killed no one cares no one's

giving a damn about it

drivers already get mta already give mta

congestion price and still aren't

allowed to allow to use a bus lane

how is that fair

the congestion won't stop because the

trucks will still double park and create

traffic

so the real solution is don't let trucks

go there and create more jobs you know

with bikes and stuff

going after rideshare drivers is not a

solution

last but not least

if mta needs money

we can only start a gofundme for you

guys

that's it

thank you

===

hey can you hear me

yes we can

good evening my name is christina rabino

i'm a brooklyn resident a writer driver

and a driver advocate

rightshad workers are already paying

their fair share

2.75 cents on right shared trips a 8.8

75 sales tax of which 0.375

is already going to mta another seven or

ten dollars or more will this further

take us into probability and that cannot

happen

minority workers should not be held

accountable for funding the mta poor

infrastructure the mta has been raising

affairs for residents long before the

right train industry came into play and

still commuters have not seen any major

changes in the last 20 years except for

a few new buses and bike lanes and and

and

and bus lanes that we ride share drivers

should have access to

in new york we should have learned that

if you increase fares on one thing you

ship the problem to something else like

reducing ridership

to right-hand drivers this will affect

our daily take from income don't punish

hard working right chair workers because

of your negligence to provide good

service to communities let's not forget

it does ride share with us right here

drivers and taxi workers rising

risking their lives to transport

essential workers don't forget that we

also saw that new york in new york two

years ago many mta executives got

million dollar bonuses

mta has money they're just using it

lavishly 100 exemption for all rideshare

workers you could fix this do better

thank you

===

thank you for giving me the opportunity

can you hear me

yes we can

yes my name is pedro acosta and i am a

brooklyn resident

and i'm also a

fresher driver

and advocating for all the right share i

mean all the fhb drivers

i am totally opposed to this

new tax congestion because that's gonna

affect us so much we have been already i

mean we are now paying a lot of taxes

we pay 440 456 dollars for a

registration when a regular pers

person just pay 120 every two year and

we pay this every year we pay from four

thousand to eight thousand dollars

insurance we pay three times in special

for our vehicles every year we pay 225

at the airport

that's one of the tax we paid 275

from the mid town below a tax congestion

already

and also we paid

2.90

black our fund

we are not able to use i mean we get

every now and then we get sick because

uh because of the bustling and bike

lanes

um sometimes i mean you are charging us

for the

accident that is happening with the

bikes lane with the bikes guy i mean but

the thing is that they are they are just

driving or they are biking like the

organized they know they are not putting

attention to the regulation and they

keep

interrupting in our lanes so

we are totally opposed to this

and i think that to prevent the traffic

trucks we should do the delivery at

night time that will help a lot thank

you so much also this is going to

complicate life for people with

disability because we driver are not

gonna be happy like spending money

buying a wheelchair vehicle because we

have so much things to pay so

that's gonna make even worse for a

wheelchair user thank you so much

thank you

===

hello

hear me yes we can

and my name is thomas m legitis

i'm the former chairman of traffic and

transportation of community board three

in staten island unfortunately staten

island is the most overtaxed br

by the mta

we have we want if you want to go to

manhattan you wind up paying 13 dollars

in totals well people in queens only

have to pay a dollar 60.

staten island has no subway we have less

public transportation in staten island

than we did in 1953.

it is ridiculous to put another another

surcharge on us to go to manhattan i

suffer from a cancer

i pray already paying 13

to go into if i have to go to get my

treatment at nyu additionally paying for

parking and paying at

eighteen percent tax on top of my

parking

we have no public transportation in

staten island sixty percent of staten

islanders have no public state

transportation within a half mile radius

if you are going to do put this taxation

plan in the back there has to be a 100

rebate for any tolls both in the

verizono and the brooklyn battery tunnel

thank you

===

um yes good evening my name is iris

smith i'm a frontline worker i live in

brooklyn i support congestion pricing

um this has been an unhealthy commute

um particularly for the healthcare which

is one of the fastest growing industries

um as a healthcare work worker

um as a health home age sometimes i care

for clients that have difficulties going

up the steps so this is personal to me

the mta can use congestion pricing for

subway stations that do not have

adequate or accommodate accessibilities

for the seniors the disabled and mothers

with strollers by building ramps

escalators and elevators in the outer

subway stations out of borough subway

station um it also states that

the traffic mobility act states that

they must have an exemption for families

making less than sixty thousand dollars

um

i support the suggestion uh suggestion

uh congestion pricing um i feel that in

brooklyn we need double busing um that

they should not have to they should be

exempt especially in remote places

that's located in brooklyn

staten island and queens and thank you

for allowing me to speak good evening

thank you

===

can you hear me now

yes we can

okay um

i am opposed to congestion pricing

the city

is shifting the burden to the public

for not doing its job the city has done

nothing

to alleviate congestion there could be

staggered hours all city agencies could

work on the weekends and not be open

on mondays and fridays they could shift

their hours to 12 p.m to 8 p.m this

would be better for the public that they

serve

city courts the libraries

the marriage bureau

all kinds of licensing agencies could be

working on the weekends and

staggered hours that would greatly

relieve congestion also the city has

caused congestion with bike lanes that

are never used or rarely used and by bus

lanes that are used every 15 minutes

and then they turn around and say

there's congestion um central park has

nine

bike lanes and somehow that's just not

enough and take away um the entire

length of central park west

for

bikers

um which

causes more congestion

and um i don't think that the department

of transportation

seen whether or not

those um

lanes are in use they're certainly not

in use from november through april and

they're hardly any use before that um

so i think until the city

takes steps to make some efforts to

alleviate congestion they can't turn

around and shift the burden to the

public

===
can you hear me

yes we can all right i want to start off

with my full opposition congestion

fighting like thousands of other people

in new york i work a regular part-time

job i'm a high school student

and taking public transportation will

take 50 percent longer than electric

cycling and more than twice as long as

someone driving me i don't got the time

or willingness to stand idle i call the

bus stops enduring commute that contains

two buses and a slow subway simply

because of my family's economic standing

everyday new yorkers will be ripped off

at this plant especially those who

already paying the tolls as it looks you

will be charging trucks who already paid

premium to make essential deliveries and

rising the costs of everyday goods you

will also be charging probably electric

vehicles and motorcyclists who are more

environmentally cleaner and take up less

space on the road this plan is utter

sick

guess who lobby for this the rich and

elite

the ceos of uber and lyft themselves who

already got

exemptions for their own companies the

wealthy manhattanites are also all in

for this this is a pocket change for

them as they reach the benefits of the

government forcing citizens to haul kids

and the disabled impartials on tightly

packed subway cars

and the argument that the mta is

underfunded is a load of garbage you got

10 billion dollars from the feds

found ways to build the most expensive

subway in the world spend 1.6 billion

dollars on a rail station in midtown

manhattan and you have almost half of

your operating expenses expenses covered

by dedicated tax revenues along this

charge people commuting north to 60th

street will take alternate routes

clogging the i-278 and highways on the

east and west side we don't need more

congestions for deliveries that that

carry foods and medicines and all of it

is taking longer and longer none of this

money will go back to road users

and will not and will not fix issues

like the brooklyn queens expressway or

the crumbling infrastructure in new york

city i love new york city not the

radical parties and corrupt agencies

like the mta that run it

and that's it

===

jose hi game hear me

yes

okay

um the mta to begin

they

from what i heard is that they do not

open their books their financial books

to the state

which is very responsible

i work in the rideshare business

and

when i pick up somebody below 96th

street they pay a fare to the mta

if i'm dropping off somebody below 96th

street that person paid a fare to the

mta

and if i pick up somebody below 96th

street

and take him to the airport

that person once they sit in my car

they pay for a mta fare

and when i drop them off at the airport

they pay for another mta fair

this is

irresponsible

for the mta to keep on

asking us to funding

the mta

and not only that but it's on the news

it comes out on the news

where they actually a lot of employees

from the mta get arrested

because they taking bribe

that is solely responsible i hope they

fix

the book

just fix it

they know how to fix the book the

financial books

so i hope they do that thank you and i

oppose
