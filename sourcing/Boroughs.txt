okay thank you well thank you to the mta

the city dot state dot and the federal

highway administration for having this

uh

these meetings these public meetings uh

i know we have a short time so many of

the questions i will uh do offline but i

just wanted to

make sure i took part today uh over the

years i've had many concerns and

opposition to congestion pricing as it

relates to the

people of staten island and the

commuters uh going to work from staten

island

and it is my hope that those uh

those concerns will be addressed as this

process goes through and as the mta

decides to go with congestion pricing

the uh stat the issues that i'm

concerned about are that staten

islanders are held harmless when it

comes to double tolling that they are

not double told because of the high toll

on the verrazano bridge and their

commute to work

in manhattan

also that revenue is dedicated to staten

island projects at a certain percentage

of the revenue uh that is

uh

that comes from congestion pricing is

put towards specific projects uh that

are important to staten island's

transportation needs and also to protect

the existing verrazano bridge discount

is very important as you move forward in

this

i hope that you take our considerations

uh to heart uh also i would suggest that

as you the mta does with with the trains

and buses with a free transfer uh that

is a suggestion i would make to the

board is some sort of transfer uh with a

time limit of about two hours if you

cross one of the outer borough bridges

uh particularly the verrazano bridge

that it doesn't cost you uh going into

the zone uh that

===

i am assembly member david weprin and i

represent the 24th assembly district i

am an advocate for more public transit

funding but this one size fits all

congestion pricing structure

is not the solution

it is an out of borough tax that will

hurt disadvantaged families in new york

city

while we are still

recovering from the covet 19 pandemic

the current congestion pricing plan is

highly manhattan-centric

and completely ignores middle-class

families and small businesses in the

outer boroughs communities in eastern

queens which i represent central

brooklyn and parts of the bronx are

transit deserts people have to take two

buses before they can reach the subway

for many their trip into manhattan can

take two hours taxing working families

who use a car to avoid a long tiring

commute will only add additional

expenses to budgets that are already too

tight this impacts the disabled who

cannot use public transit and the

elderly who need to get to a medical

appointment fast furthermore the mta is

set to receive 10.5 billion dollars in

federal dollars what is the mta going to

be doing with that money the mta has

been notorious for mismanaging funds we

shouldn't have to subsidize these

wasteful practices i would support

modifications to congestion pricing

which would allow those who are

low-income seniors disabled from transit

deserts to receive an exemption or pay a

lower toll there are other ways to

generate revenue such as ending the

stipulated fine program restoring the

commuter tax or increasing fees on app

based for higher vehicles we must focus

on fixing the mta while ensuring it is

not at the expense of working families

in the outer boroughs there is no

exception or tax credit as there is in

the central business directorate for

people in transit desert thank you

===

thank you my name is eric dinowitz new

york city council member for the 11th

district in the bronx

i want to express some concerns about

the central business district tolling

program

we know fewer cars on the roads a good

thing for the for new york city

raising revenue to improve our aging

subway infrastructure and inefficient

bus system is of the utmost importance

that said we must ensure that the

revenue raised from this proposal is

disbursed equitably this program must

not become a blank check for improving

the condition of public transportation

in manhattan alone

especially since many of the people

driving into manhattan do so because of

poor transit options where they are

currently the only information we have

shows that roughly 80 percent of the

revenue from the program will benefit

new york city transit no further

breakdown of where those funds will be

used

the plan must include

dedicated funding for each borough

based on factors such as ridership and

need which includes accessibility it's

one of the biggest issues we currently

have with our subway system

accessibility there are too many

stations that do not accommodate people

with disabilities or older adults

only 24 of the stations in new york city

are fully accessible and predictably

the bronx is below that figure

according to a new york city

controller's report 59

of neighborhoods in the bronx do not

have access to ada compliance stations

compared with only 26

in manhattan that has to change

we also have a bus system that does not

fully meet the needs of bronx residents

whether it's to get to and from the

subway travel across the bronx or use

the express bus to get downtown

this only reliable ada compliant mode of

transportation is often shortchanged

resulting in long wait times bunching

and the treatment of bus riders as

second-class commuters again dedicated

funding which will likely be paid by

outer borough residents to making the

entire subway system accessible and

investing in our bus system especially

underserved communities like the bronx

must be paramount

when deciding how to disperse these

monies thank you

===

thank you cbdtp admins for letting me

speak this morning i'm here to voice my

strong support for the cbd towing in

manhattan and energy mta to speed up the

process to implement the program as

quickly as possible too much time has

already been wasted and too much time is

seemingly going to be spent on reaching

out to the public

new york city is choking in car exhaust

our streets are overly congested all day

every day pedestrians and bicyclists are

put in danger every day as they have

become squeezed out while the city does

next to nothing to prevent to limit

private vehicle access use in the

transit-rich towing zone in manhattan

buses get hopelessly stuck in this

congestion and everybody loses the

status quo is not working people from

all over the region city residents and

otherwise drive into the core of

manhattan because there is no incentive

for them not to other than the time lost

due to the time they spent in congestion

that they themselves are helping to

create people avoid transit because

they're somehow able to drive over the

east river bridges and into manhattan

for free and for some reason on sundays

they're allowed to park for free while

transit riders have to pay their fair

share every day of the week all the time

beyond traffic in just in manhattan all

of these drivers have to go through

other communities to get there traffic

in brooklyn in queens is a disaster

right now as people squeeze onto the

bridges to access manhattan just look at

the constant flow of cars off the

brooklyn bridge snaking their way

through brooklyn heights onto the bqe

just to avoid the toll at the battery

tunnel the same at the 59th street

bridge and queensborough posit just to

avoid the midtown tunnel this has to be

controlled if confronted with the

financial incentive to actually take

public transit people will change their

modes of transportation and it will help

make the city more livable for everybody

for those who absolutely must drive into

the central business district area for

some reason their toll will help pay for

better transit for everybody i also urge

the committee to not overburden the

program with exemptions and carve outs

that would water down to the program and

harm it for everybody again i urge the

mta to implement cbd tolling as soon as

possible 16 months is time we just do

not have to waste thank you

===

um 2023

is

far far too long for this project to

wait before being implemented buses are

at a crawl hundreds of thousands of

people rely on our on our

bus system that is absolutely joked in

traffic day in day out every single day

the

actual residents of new york city are

are being forced to sit in car traffic

that uh that they simply can't afford to

uh they simply can't avoid

i think that a 2023 date for the

implementation of this is

beyond too long this uh the central

business district tolling program should

have gone into place

five years ago

three years ago two years ago last year

yesterday

i encourage

everyone involved to get this project

done completed and implemented as soon

as possible i don't think anybody here

who works in

any kind of private capacity would allow

for a 16-month stall before actual

implementation of a necessary

profit earning program thank you

thank you

===

i just want to say i'm disgusted

with this whole thing because new york

city d.o.t new york state d.o.t the mta

they do nothing about all the illegal

government employees parking all over

the city and no standing zones and bus

lanes and don't even get me started

because i met with hank gutman i told

the mayor de blasio i talked to the

staten island dlt people you guys do

nothing about people distracted driving

is the number one cause of accidents for

a decade now okay you're letting people

drive with cell phones mounted on their

windshield they don't even look at the

road they're staring at a cell phone

screen on their windshield okay it's

disgusting okay and now for staten

islanders they close the two lanes going

inbound into brooklyn at the bqe so we

know that the express buses are delayed

getting into manhattan for the evening

rush because they use the ul terry

tunnel okay so why isn't the money going

towards the repairing the bqe at the

triple promenade we're talking millions

of dollars here we've got the best

people in this city and state and we're

just that's what we do on the triple

promenade it's a joke i am disgusted

with the mta with the department of

transportation you people were a day

late and a dollar short thinking about

this okay you could have put the tools

on the east river bridges and been done

with it but now you got to get 28

different counties in the tri-state area

involved you're going to have off-peak

hours peak periods i mean for me i live

in noodle up in staten island i usually

start my day at six or seven a.m in

manhattan if i'm working in manhattan

okay to get to 23rd and 6th avenue for a

six a.m call you know what time i got to

leave my house at three o'clock in the

morning i can guarantee everybody who's

working for the nta has probably never

woken up at three or four o'clock in the

morning for work okay what kind of life

is it if i go to work for 10 hours and

then i'm commuting two hours each way to

get back and forth to work when i can

just drive and save myself two hours

yeah i gotta pay 25 hours for an early

bird parking but guess what that's my

choice i'm not going to be a slave to

mta and just keep giving more money to

you guys it's ridiculous

===

yes okay

good morning my name is mackenzie fillo

i live in brooklyn right next to the

entrance to the brooklyn bridge and i

work in lower manhattan i strongly

support congestion pricing

and urge mta to implement it as soon as

possible

we need to implement congestion pricing

to help mitigate the impact of the

coming climate disaster

most new yorkers don't even have cars

and the government should encourage

those who do to drive less and take the

subway more

congestion pricing will do just that

but even putting complex

climate change aside completely

congestion pricing is still a great idea

that will dramatically improve the lives

of new yorkers

drivers are becoming increasingly

unhinged this is the deadliest year on

our streets in some time

drivers speed and run red lights

causing death injury and disability in

numbers that should shock everyone they

also park on the sidewalk and in the

bike lane and in the bus lane and cars

are noisy they disturb the peace and

they spew fumes that cause asthma and

they clog our streets slowing down

ambulances and fire trucks as they

respond to emergencies

cars make life worse for new yorkers and

everything we can do to reduce driving

will improve life here

moreover if we reduce the number of

people driving into the city we can

repurpose some of the space currently

dedicated to cars and we can have wider

sidewalks and more trees and grass it is

a win-win i urge mta to speed up the

timeline for instituting congestion

pricing and to grant only those

exemptions required by the legislature

every exemption that you grant will

reduce the effectiveness of the program

thank you

===

uh my name is steven scalisi i'm a

licensed professional traffic engineer

um

i have three

things to say and first of all as a

preliminary i'm all for congestion

pricing and it would affect me but i

think time has come

for it to be implemented in our city

first question is and these are mostly

procedural

parking on the queens and brooklyn sides

of the free bridges and above sixtieth

street needs to be included in the

environmental assessment i'm sure it is

but in terms of queens and brooklyn it's

not just the other side of the bridge

it's further inland where people can

park on the street

and hop on the subway

secondly

i'm sure there is a regional model

traffic simulation model that's being

used

i've worked with many firms in the past

it has to be a demand responsive model

not just a

uh stochastic model

that means it's not just being input and

then hit a button and see what the

results are has to be

deterministic to see that traffic is

moving around based on inputs such as

toll prices

third maybe the most important is the

the traffic data collection

um

you know they say garbage in garbage out

when was the traffic input into the

model is it pre-pandemic levels or now

during the pandemic which we all know

traffic volumes are low

so i'd like to make sure that whoever

doing that model

that they account for pre versus during

versus post pandemic to make sure that

the model is as accurate as possible to

assess impacts

uh that's it for now thank you for your

input it was a very fine presentation

thank you

===

hello

uh i'm a born and bred new yorker uh

hailing from the deeper reaches of

queens i've been traveling into the cbd

on a regular basis since middle school

it's where i got my education on my

first job after college

and not once did i ever think it would

be a good idea to travel there by car i

took a bus to a train like most queen's

commuters going to manhattan

the car is a scourge in new york city

new yorkers cannot hear ourselves think

with all the noise cars create we cannot

breathe the air without damaging our

lungs we can't even safely cross the

street because of the threat of the

automobile in our city this leads to a

few questions

why do we allow ourselves

why do we allow such a dangerous and

environmentally harmful instrument to

come into the densest part of our city

without any limits or restrictions why

do we allow drivers to externalize all

of the costs their transportation mode

incurs on everyone while they enjoy all

of the benefits

this isn't a sustainable model for

transportation and the gridlock we're

witnessing manhattan proves it there is

a better way

we can internalize the cost of driving

by charging a fee to enter the cbd

we can put a price on driving so

individuals who engage in this harmful

act have to reconsider whether they

truly need to get in their cars

we can use the money generated by the

program to fund capital projects for the

mta and improve public transportation

for everybody which will make new york a

cleaner more equitable city that will

become a model of transportation justice

for the entire country

i encourage the traffic mobility review

board to enact congestion pricing

swiftly after this environmental

assessment is completed i encourage them

to not create any exemptions beyond

those defined in the mta reform and

traffic mobility act i encourage the

governor to override any attempts to

water down this first indonesian program

i look forward to a day when new york

city is once again

able to deliver on its promise a better

life for all thank you

===

thank you thank

you for this opportunity to speak my

name is philip i'm a lifelong resident

of the bronx

i'm here to express my concern about the

possible implementation of congestion

pricing which i believe unfairly affects

the residents of the well less wealthy

outer boroughs like millions of new york

city residents i take the subway to work

to manhattan every day and understand

the need to find funding for the mta to

ensure that this critical function is

able to operate however i have concerns

about this proposal because i believe it

ultimately makes outer borough residents

pay for subway repair while not

addressing the actual reason for the

increased congestion in manhattan over

the last decade which have been the

increase of four higher vehicles from

companies such as uber and lyft in fact

the 2019 quinnipiac poll showed that a

vast majority of new york city residents

especially in the bronx are against

congestion pricing

due to its manhattan

centric nature

so let me talk about some of these

concerns like i said reducing for hire

vehicles should be the primary focus of

any attempts to quote decongest the

central business district instead of

asking the outer boroughs to pay

we all know that companies like uber

have actively lobbied for congestion

pricing which indicates that they stand

to benefit from this

you know

as far as the environmental aspect look

i've battled for against pipelines for

the green you deal this is a small

band-aid in that quest so but however if

there is an environmental aspect to it

there should be an exemption for hybrid

and electric vehicles finally

my biggest concern is how do we know

that places like the bronx will get the

fair benefits of this when it happens

and that the funds will not just go to

places like the hudson yards

or expanding the second avenue subway

into newly gentrified areas

right remember this scheme was pedaled

to us through the move ny plan which

called for reductions in bridge and

outer borough tolls to compensate for

this manhattan-centric nature

you know as a resident of new york city

i hope this never passes there are a

better way to fund the mta let's tax the

rich let's do something else but let's

not do it off the backs of people from

the bronx thank you

===

good morning and thank you for giving me

the time to talk like the person before

me i'm also a bronx resident that

commutes into new york city every day

um via train and so i also feel as

though that the congestion pricing would

represent an unfair burden to one of the

poorest counties in the city

and one of the poorest counties in the

country

what we find is with the mta

particularly if you live in the bronx

that the trains aren't reliable weekend

service is often not operational daytime

service particularly on the 2 train

which project

has been

going on for at least 10 or 15 years is

non-existent and so sometimes driving is

the only way to do that i don't think

this panel has looked at

what has created the congestion which is

the increased number of uber lyft and

other

taxis and tlc vehicles

as well as the introduction of buses and

bike lanes and so i think while a study

has not been done to see how that has

impacted the congestion

downtown that we are then asking the

residents and the poorest residents of

the city to then

shoulder the burden

additionally if there are plans as there

was mentioned before to have tolls on

the bridges and tunnels or the bridges

coming in from the bronx into the city

again i think it represents an unfair

way of generating money for what has

been notoriously one of the most

inefficient agencies in the city

um i think like the person before me

mentioned there are other ways to look

at how to reduce congestion and there

are other ways to make some of these tlc

uber lyft type of places or type of

companies bear some of this

responsibility instead of being the most

vocal advocates for congestion pricing

and which then you really have to look

at the irony of that

again i think it is the unfair burden on

the outer boroughs

ah thank you i just want to say i think

it's an unfair burden to people in the

outer boroughs who have very limited

ways of getting downtown throughout

various days of the week

===

yes hi

i'm not seeing uh

okay there we go

my name is phil konigsberg

and i live in northeast queens

for the past 14 years i've opposed any

attempt to implement a congestion

pricing toll program

every time a new plan arises from the

grave

because it unfairly targets motorists

from the outer boroughs who must travel

into the center city

i am once again testifying against the

latest effort this morning

there are a multitude of outer borough

residents who are physically unable to

ride mass transit

and their only mode of transportation

into manhattan is via a private vehicle

the new york city d.o.t issues a parking

placard to persons with severe permanent

disabilities

allowing them to park in otherwise

restricted areas

i'm glad to see that there's indication

that

exemptions will be made for them

for these individuals but i would like

to know further details

when there are numerous medical

facilities available in the while there

are numerous medical facilities

available in the outer boroughs the

major hospitals remain concentrated in

manhattan

and add an additional surcharge

on top of existing bridge and tunnel

tolls and parking costs

is an unreasonable hardship

for any new yorker

who is unable to use mass transit and

has to enter the center city

to obtain medical care

a better plan is to cut down on the four

high higher drivers the uber and the

lifts

use the nypd and the dot

traffic enforcements units to enforce

the illegal double parking and blocking

of priority bus lanes

and develop a plan

to restrict all commercial deliveries to

late night and early mornings i also

think a good way is to

reinstate the commuter tax thank you

===

good morning

i'm patrick harrell and i live in

brooklyn

um and i'm speaking in support of this

idea

like many other americans i grew up in a

really polluted area and as a child i

developed asthma um

it was debilitating as a child

uh one year i missed 25 days of school

because of the asthma attacks

persistent you know illnesses from

that asthma and this dynamic plays out

thousands of times across the country

and it is a choice it's a choice that we

continue to allow our air to be polluted

not every kid that misses 25 days to

school doesn't get left behind and there

are so many people that

you know

drop out of school basically because of

health issues

studies have shown time after time that

there's a very clear link between

educational attainment and pollution in

the area

basically because of asthma illnesses as

well as some sort of less understood

impacts on

on childhood development

as i've returned commuting to manhattan

i have encountered more and more idling

cars as the traffic volume have gone up

both in manhattan and on the bridges

waiting to go into manhattan

and i just would urge the mta to

implement this policy as quickly as

possible

to address this air quality crisis in

the city today

thank you

===

my name is anya i live in brooklyn and i

ride a motorcycle i rely on my

motorcycle to allow me to travel to and

from transit deserts that i wouldn't be

able to affordably access without it it

is my lifeline to the city and it makes

it possible for me to take fewer taxis

and not spend hours upon hours on buses

many folks who live in transit deserts

who can't afford a car rely on

motorcycles and motor scooters to help

them get into the cbd so that they can

work i implore you to give a 100 percent

exemption for motorcycles and motor

scooters from the congestion proposed

congested pricing

encouraging folks to use their cars less

and instead use motorized two-wheeled

vehicles will best serve the stated

goals of the congestion pricing

initiative while not penalizing

vulnerable communities and folks whose

transportation choices are already

serving the best interests of our city

by exempting them from congestion

pricing we will be encouraging the use

of motorized two-wheeled vehicles which

will dramatically reduce air traffic

congestion fuel consumption carbon

dioxide emissions and crowded parking

there are numerous studies that show

that by replacing even a small minority

of cars with motorized two-wheeled

vehicles leads to these benefits sam

schwartz our former nyc traffic

commissioner himself did a study that

showed that if the daytime mix of

vehicles shifted to what 80 percent cars

and only 20 percent motorized

two-wheeled vehicles nyc would see a

reduction in traffic delays of more than

4.6 million hours per year which is

nearly 100 working hours per year per

person it would also lead to a massive

carbon dioxide emission reductions and

millions of gallons of reduced fuel

consumption it adds up to a total

savings for new york city of more than

122 million per year in fuel and labor

productivity there is a very strong

precedent for making these exemptions

nearly every major city in europe has

provided special exemptions for

two-wheeled motor vehicles because they

recognize the incredible value that

their cities gain and reduce

traffic congestion increase transit

equality reduce environmental impact and

fuel consumption reduce wear and tear on

their infrastructure and increase safety

for bicyclists and pedestrians by having

people ride their small light and fuel

efficient two-wheeled motor vehicles a

motorcycle weighs a tiny fraction of

a tiny fraction of what a car weighs

reducing damage to our roads and you can

fit six motorcycles in a single car

parking space it's essential that we

emphasize the greater reliance on public

transit yeah available

===

thank you uh sorry just a moment please

um

i believe that the uh the central uh

business district tolling program as

proposed is inherently flawed that the

the wealthiest people already live in

manhattan below 60th street so this

translates into a tax on the traveling

poor and attacks on the outer boroughs i

think the proposal also includes flawed

evidence on how travel speeds have

decreased for buses

new york city's vision zero effort is

largely responsible for slowing buses

it's focused on a wholesale slowing of

vehicles without studying any side

effects including bus routes on those

streets

but understanding the studies already

underway my specific suggestions include

that the study

study impacts on neighborhoods near the

boundary on the opposite side of

manhattan near bridges in addition to

the tunnels mentioned in the

presentation

that the toll amount should be lower for

the occasional use and raised to be

higher with more frequent use which

aligns with the study's goal to reduce

vehicle congestion in the area

and most importantly that the toll

applied to all vehicles from city

agencies and to those with city placards

many of the vehicles coming into the

central business district are employees

of the courts and the agency

headquarters there already enjoying free

parking so this is an equity issue do

not allow a privileged municipal class

to make the rules for others while

giving themselves a workaround even the

governor the mayor and city council

members should pay the toll if they

drive into the area

thank you

===

yes can you hear me

yes we can

all right my name is sheila shapiro and

i am a member of the forest hills green

team which is a local environmental

group in queens

new york city needs to embrace

congestion pricing

charging fees on vehicles driving into

or within manhattan central business

district is projected to raise over a

billion dollars a year for mass transit

in new york city while helping weekday

traffic in manhattan move faster

expensive upgrades are essential for our

subway and bus systems which are already

underfunded and in crisis

recent u n reports warn we have less

than 12 years to avoid the worst climate

crisis scenarios because congestion

pricing will lower carbon emissions by

shifting more trips from vehicles to

mass transit it is an essential part of

new york's response according to a

community service society study

only four percent of outer borough

residents drive to manhattan for work

congestion pricing is considered the

single biggest contributor of

predictable sustainable revenue

for this purpose

these fees can be required to be used

only for mass transit improvements

at the same time the mta needs to be

reformed and closely monitored thank you

===

hi good morning thanks for this

presentation today i'm here to voice my

emphatic support for congestion pricing

i live in brooklyn i go to school and i

work in downtown brooklyn and

the cbd area

i'm an asthmatic and my asthma is

triggered by air pollution

vehicle tailpipe emissions are a major

part contributor to air pollution in new

york city

and for that we need congestion pricing

in here

there is a legitimate concern that

congestion pricing does not solve the

pollution problem but i would just point

out that other cities around the world

have done this

london implemented congestion pricing in

2003 their air pollution has gone down

their vehicle travel speeds have gone up

and it's become a more sustainable safer

city for everybody involved

uh

furthermore i do agree with the

panelists who pointed out that there

should be a motorcycle exemption or at

least a motorcycle reduction in toll

rates

uh

well also i would want to point out that

um

that ride share should not get a one ta

a once a day toll it should be charged

per trip

but uh i want to advocate this because

uh we need to disincentivize ride share

ubers had increased congestion by 30 percent

in manhattan uh over it uh since its

inception

uh furthermore i would want to point out

that car most new yorkers do not have

access to a car 54 percent of new yorkers don't

have access to a car

new yorkers who have access to a car uh

in general earn 44000

more than non-car owners in new york

city car owners are a lot richer than

non-car owners in new york city car

owners are minority congestion pricing is

the way to go we need better investment

in our transit we need to eliminate our

transit deserts we need better buses we

need better trains we need more

accessible trains and for that

congestion pricing now thank you

===

alright so

would i uh disagree with is that the

insinuation right is that drivers are

the problem that drivers are creating an

externality

that they're not paying for the price

they pay to go in the city right but the

intent is to force people out of driving

and divert that money to the mta and the

logic behind this is that this will

force car drivers to take the subway

but before covid the ridership levels

were spiking right they doubled in 2014

and multiple lines were over capacity

since 2007. it's not like they increased

fair even to solve the problems right

i mean the mta was in a state of

emergency then too

so if we're going to pretend that you

know there's too many people driving

cars then logically increasing amount of

riders would increase the amount of

fares and this should solve the problem

but it didn't because drivers aren't the

problem for them to use problems

whereas the city and state levels for

decades

took funding out i mean 16 of the mta's

budget goes to paying off the exploded

of high interest loans that new york

state forced the mta to take i mean of

the remaining budget

how much money do we spend on stuff like

the hudson yards renovation that cost

1.4 billion dollars

and then of the remaining funding that

we have that's used for real projects

that will increase the mta's response

time like the renovation of the signal

systems

we pay the highest prices in the world

for that so for the lirr east access

project project we paid seven times the

average worldwide price for a track

mile

for the east for the the second avenue

line we paid five times the average per

track cost for for for the track mile

and then

the logic behind this is that

we're gonna fix that with the new money

i mean where'd the money go we had the

money where'd it go so i don't

understand how this is gonna fix any of

the problems because we've wasted the

money already that's all thank you

===

hi there my name is charlie raffanello

i'm a resident of queens new york um i

appreciate you guys giving us the

opportunity to speak today

it seems to me

congestion pricing is an inevitable

thing in our future um there's one

exemption i want to speak about and i

believe that is motorcycles our vehicles

demonstrably reduce congestion in this

city just as bicycles e-bikes and

scooters do the city has invested a lot

of time and energy

in making those uh means of

transportation more accessible for

people i believe we should be included

in that as well the difference between

e-bikes and scooters and motorcycles is

that we are licensed and insured and

therefore we are accountable for our

actions on the road

our vehicles are also very fuel

efficient we're trying to build a green

city we're trying to take care of our

future

my sv650 makes about 50 miles to the

gallon i've seen it go as high as 58

miles to the gallon

our vehicles are also lightweight and

reduce wear and tear on the road

therefore saving the city money and

saving on greenhouse emissions because

they're not going to require as much uh

construction equipment to fix the roads

after we're done

we also take a minimal amount of parking

spaces you could fit about six

motorcycles where average car or suv

would fit

and finally if you look at what other

cities and municipalities have

implemented congestion pricing have done

they all have given motorcycles

exemption and i believe that in new york

city we deserve the same thing thank you

very much for your time

===

so i'm going to echo some of the

some of the points that a few of the

other speakers have made

my name is gil i live in

brooklyn and i am a motorcycle rider and

i want to

advocate for

a 100 percent exemption for motorcycles um

several uh major cities around the world

have done this with huge success it's

been a it's been you know crucial to

them to these other cities to reduce

congestion and to alleviate problems um

motorcycles are

you know we're a solution to the problem

we are lightweight we take up very

little space we reduce wear and tear on

the roads

we also take up a fraction of parking

that cars and trucks do even though we

pay the same amount for parking

on city streets and most importantly

motorcycles are are extremely fuel

efficient and they're part of the

solution for combating climate change

uh the motorcycle that i usually commute

with gets almost 70 miles to the gallon

um

which is significant um

yeah so i once again i advocate for a

100 percent exemption from the toll for

motorcycles and

i would also like to request more

dedicated motorcycle parking in the city

to encourage more riders more licensed

and trained riders to uh to take up

motorcycle riding thank you

thank you

===

hi i'm joseph and i just want to say

that congestion pricing no good this

plane will affect 700000 people it's

like that's like half that's like almost

a million people not to mention the

outer borough commuters who might be in

fact impacted based on the conditions

this charge will bring on top of that

your agency already charges drivers

money who you take from bridges and

tunnels like the verrazano bridge the

hugh l carry and queen's midtown

traffic on the i-278 is already stressed

with the deteriorating bqe as

drivers going farther northbound

manhattan will use this route to avoid

the toll we don't need more traffic on

the main expressway that supplies new

york city with essentials like food and

medicine deliveries we don't need trucks

we need to make deliveries into

manhattan's core to be charged extra

money who will they pass that charge on

it'll they'll pass it on to us the

average working person new jersey

drivers staten islanders will suffer big

prompting those work working five days a

week to lose up to six thousand dollars

in income this is pocket change to the

rich but a big change for people working

in the office or just as a low-key

restaurant server i'm from brooklyn

every time you air ads saying take the

train i feel like laughing i live in the

depths of brooklyn there is no subway

nobody cares about our neighborhoods

even cycling can compete with transit at

30 percent faster speeds for my commute

at 16 and just riding an e-bike

currently i'm convinced that public

transportation is a no-no for me

i'm not going to spend extra money just

hauling on public train

freezing at bus stops or waiting in

outdoor platforms with no heat

nor will i sit on the queensborough

bridge forever simply because my family

can't afford the surcharge

also it's not congestion pricing if

these tools are in effect 24 7 at like

2am in the morning

like seriously stop ripping off the

middle class save new york city thank

you for listening

===

good morning i wholeheartedly support

the expedited implementation of

congestion pricing i want to tell you

about my commute from brooklyn into our

office at 377 broadway in the central

business district let me walk you

through how drivers choices impact me

and everyone else that uses the canal

street subway station

and remember as i leave the station i

start commuting in our city's most used

mode by foot

from the steps of the subway exit i can

hear the horns blaring my blood pressure

spikes immediately reaching the sidewalk

i take off my mask and take a deep

breath of exhaust fumes the first thing

i see when i get out of the subway

drivers darting through yellow lights

stacking up in the crosswalk

gridlock ensues and pedestrians like me

are forced to weave our way through

impatient drivers i make eye contact to

ensure i'm not hit by a driver as they

try to crawl through to gain that one

extra inch

i intentionally choose to walk downtown

away from canal street to avoid as much

of the chaos as possible but with every

change of the light drivers race forward

to win that one extra second

it puts cyclists and pedestrians in

harm's way as i walk down broadway i

pass a ghost bike a memorial marking

where a driver has hit and killed a

cyclist

i watch working cyclists hurrying to

their next delivery and i fear for them

so every step between my subway and my

office a nightmare because of the

congestion caused by drivers

it doesn't have to be this way we can

have and deserve to have safer less

congested and more efficient city

streets we need congestion pricing asap

i ask that we pass congestion pricing to

ensure all new yorkers can safely use

our streets and my nightmare walk can be

turned into a beautiful new york stroll

thank you

===

there we go hello can you hear me we can

very good my name is phil bader i'm a

member of disabled in action i'm a

person with a disability who depends on

his car to get around the city the

subways are not an option for me and

there is no bus service between brooklyn

where i live and manhattan

i believe that this

central district district tolling

program needs to have accommodations for

people with disabilities who depend on

their cars

i'm not a monster who uses his car

improperly and i'm not rich i believe

there should be some kind of

accommodations for people with

disabilities who drive

thank you

===

yes hello can you hear me we can

thank you

i'm jean ryan i'm president of disabled

in action of metropolitan new york

i live in bay ridge brooklyn

but we have many members in all

boroughs

we are the largest minority

um

disabled in action supports congestion

pricing to reduce traffic reduce

pollution and to raise a great deal of

money to improve and expand public

transit we hope that once the subway

system has elevators kept in good

condition in every station

some of our reliance on access a ride will

be able to be reduced or maybe even

eliminated as far as exemptions we

support exempting taxis access ride

vehicles and for hire vehicles that

are used for excess ride use

already for hire vehicle drivers do

not want to pay tolls and we are afraid

the drivers will refuse to take us to

manhattan or pick us up in manhattan

some people will want even more

exemptions but that will defeat the

purpose of congestion practicing

thank you very much

===

good morning can you hear me we can

okay good morning thank you for giving

me the opportunity to speak yes my name

is harold moskowitz i live

in queens i work

in midtown manhattan i own a business on

first avenue between 54th and 55th

street i am strongly against congestion

pricing

strongly against it i am a serviceman

i'm also a motorcyclist for those of you

who are listening i cannot do the

service calls on the motorcycle it is

not

possible i need 60 pounds worth of tools

to do service calls

plus material i employ four people once

again you are making me the enemy you

made me the enemy with the bike lanes

you made me the enemy with the bus lanes

you're making me the enemy again

with congestion pricing when your

plumbing breaks in midtown who's going

to fix it when the walls leak who's

going to fix it when you need flooring

who's going to do it the man who went on

before me and said all these prices are

going to get passed down to you brother

you're right

every single penny of this is going to

get passed down to the consumer how are

you going to get food onto that island

it's coming on 18 wheelers that's the

only way

now i hear all about

exemptions the bikers want exemptions

very good okay what about me do i get an

exemption no i don't i'm still the enemy

you still want me to pay

once again you have made me the enemy

you want to know what's going to happen

people are going to close up they're

going to leave manhattan

it is going to become a ghost town no

one will want to go there and

incidentally the ubers and the lyft they

get a pass don't they they get a pass

but i have to pay

why

why am i the enemy

why

thank you

===

hi i'm caitlin pearce um i'm here today

to testify on behalf of rider's alliance

to urge the governor and the mta to

implement congestion pricing as quickly

as possible

it's been two years since new york city

riders won a congestion pricing program

in new york and we cannot afford to wait

any longer to implement it

each year that this plan is delayed

transit riders are losing out on at

least a billion dollars in absolutely

critical

improvements for a more reliable and a

more accessible service uh this is at a

time when the mta is already facing a

multi-billion dollar budget gap that

it's going to need to fill to be able to

operate at full capacity

what we need at this moment is a transit

system that our working and middle class

new yorkers in all boroughs can depend

upon to take them to work and to get

them home to their families on time

what riders are experiencing today

daily

subway delays caused by ancient signal

technology in an outdated system

according to mta's own data on time

performance ranks near the bottom of

major transit systems in the developed

world

riders who depend on elevators face the

subway system that is near impossible to

navigate with few accessible stations

and elevators that are almost

way too frequently out of service

and riders experience buses that are

unreliable and maddeningly slow stuck

behind gridlock traffic

congestion pricing will deliver

overwhelmingly positive environmental

impacts by reducing car congestion by

clearing the air of excessive vehicle

exhaust

by raising funds that will be invested

in delivering cleaner transportation for

millions of new yorkers

and it's a progressive means as noted in

the mta's own presentation of raising

revenue from those who can afford the

cost of car ownership and traveling into

the city by car

we call we call upon the governor and

the mta to do everything in their power

to implement congestion pricing quickly

and fairly today thank you very much

===

good morning i'm a lifelong resident of

a double fare zone in queens county a

retired 33-year new york city public

school teacher and avid bicycle rider

and i often take public transportation

but i've also been an active driver in

our city for over four decades i urge

our decision makers to consider new york

city taxpayers who rely on their

vehicles

we should not be double taxed to travel

in our own city whether to work to

frequent shows theaters museums parks

restaurants or any other economic or

cultural generator if congestion pricing

is to be implemented new york city

residents need to be exempted or reduced

during business hours and deserve and

need free access to our city in the

evenings and weekends

businesses and cultural institutions

rely on clientele from outside manhattan

to support their establishments people

regardless of where they live should be

able to access our city after peak hours

and weekends to frequent and support

them consider a family of four from

eastern queens thinking of going to

battery park for a sunday picnic

followed by a trip to a museum the cost

would be over 50 or more and the extra

time commuting would add several hours

to what should be a simple family outing

for most people that would just dissuade

them from ever going to our city as a

child my dad put us to work at a family

restaurant in the upper east side i grew

up in our city's museums and would later

take those sunday trips with my own

family when i became an art teacher in

this great city it was sad when i worked

with students in brooklyn and queens to

find out that many never had been to

manhattan until i took him there on

field trips

families in the outer borders deserve

the right to enjoy and share our city's

parks and cultural institutions in

closing our taxes paid for the right to

use and travel within our city with

undue restriction the dollars we spend

on maintenance drivers spend on

maintenance insurance tolls gas attacks

it provides contributes greatly to our

city's economy and infrastructure

restricting manhattan from those of us

who live in the outer boroughs with

further taxation especially during

non-congestion hours and weekends is

elitist immoral and just plain wrong we

cannot further wall off the island of

manhattan only for the rich

who can afford to live or travel there i

urge the mta to grant fair consideration

to the outer borough taxpayers and

citizens of this great cities thank you

===

hi i'm raymond and i strongly believe

that congestion pricing is an important

tool to achieve a more equitable

sustainable and people-centric city it

is imperative to reduce the amount of

cars within new york city which creates

a whole host of new and exciting ways to

use the space formally taken up by cars

while helping fund our public

transportation congestion pricing is

more reflective of the real cost of

driving in the city both in terms of

land costs the land that physic the road

physically sits on as well as the

negative effects that they have in the

environment and people of new york city

with congestion pricing we we can open

up the space on our roads freeing up um

sorry freeing up space for more active

transportation and creating

um much more reliable public

transportation for faster buses to

raising the funds necessary for subway

modernization we cannot as a result give

rebates to those entering the central

business districts that are not an

emergency vehicle someone who lives

within the congestion zone or an e-bike

or motorcyclist and yes this includes

those from new jersey even with its 12

to 18 dollar tolls on the

hudson river because

the

because even with that toll there is

currently a massive bottleneck going to

and from new jersey on the tunnels and

bridges

such as the holland tunnel resulting in

various delays to mta buses

and other modes of transit

one example is the m21 bus which

frequently is over delayed and has been

cancelled every single day this month

for the mta this is a really good way to

modernize a system and to create a

system that is meant for all new yorkers

this is why congestion pricing is

critical for the sustained

future of public transportation and the

economy as a whole in new york thank you

thank you

===

sarah hello can you hear me okay

hi my name is sarah i live in brooklyn

and i am here today to voice my strong

support of implementing congestion

pricing in new york city as quickly as

possible

i used to take the train everywhere but

in the couple months into the pandemic i

got a car

because i had injured my knee which made

climbing the stairs at my local station

too painful and there isn't a train

station with a reliable working elevator

near my home

i miss taking the train it used to be

the easiest and fastest way for me to

get around the city

and i want to start riding again

but a few things are stopping me

train service is infrequent and

unreliable and i still have problems

with the stairs

to make the subway efficient reliable

and accessible the mta needs money

congestion pricing will give the mta an

ongoing source of revenue that it

desperately needs to build and maintain

subway station elevators and modern

system

a reliable transit system also benefits

my community by decreasing car

congestion in the street and air

pollution in our neighborhoods it will

also make it easier for me on the

occasions that i need to drive into the

city for a doctor's appointment as i

won't be in the gridlocked traffic of

the past few months

i am happy to contribute my part

whenever i drive into manhattan

paying that fee will benefit me in the

long run and it will also benefit my

neighbors and all new yorkers so please

take my money

thank you

===

good morning everyone thank you so much

for hearing my testimony today uh my

name is lola and i'm a resident of

bed-stuy brooklyn i moved here just a

few months ago but i have lived near the

jmz line for over five years

i have been working the bronx for the

past six months commuting every day by

subway and i have spent nearly 18 hours

on the train every week i'm here today

to avoid my strong support of

implementing a robust congestion pricing

program in new york city as quickly as

possible

our subway infrastructure is crumbling

and there were days that i had to take

six trains to get to work and i faced

significant weights every time i had to

transfer

during the pandemic it has been even

more difficult to commute and as a

recovery we need congestion pricing more

than average to speed up buses and

emergency vehicles and make public

transit as convenient as attractive as

possible

congestion pricing would raise at least

15 billion

to fix and modernize the subway which

could update the silence system that is

based on 1930s technology and also

decreased train delays or changing

routes i would also like to mention the

bizarre and tragic scenes in the subway

during the last thunderstorms and

hurricanes this summer which makes me

very nervous to take uh to have to take

the train tonight during the rain and

it's unacceptable for new yorkers to

have to risk their lives in flooded

stations as new york faces

more extreme weather than ever before we

need to upgrade our subway system to be

safer during these events

in addition to raising money

to improve the stations production

pricing would also have a positive

environment effect by clearing the air

and investing in cleaner transportation

for millions of people

thank you for your time

===

thank you thank you hearing my comment

i speak to you as a car owner a cyclist

a pedestrian and a strap hanger and i

speak to you as an outer borough

resident i support the institution of

congestion pricing but i also urge you

to improve the means by which it is

implemented quite simply we need to ask

ourselves how a properly functioning

city should be organized a city

dependent on inefficient polluting

expensive and dangerous private vehicles

to transport its population is not

functioning properly many others have

already spoken about the benefits of

congestion pricing and getting vehicles

off the road so i will only offer this

one perspective which i believe is

different from what has already been

stated

there are times when using a private car

to travel is warranted unfortunately as

a driver the level of congestion that

concurrently afflicts the city deeply

empowers the usefulness of driving

recognizing that there are times when

car travel makes sense we should be

taking measures that improve the

efficiency of driving when it cannot be

avoided when i need to drive into

manhattan i would gladly pay if it meant

the roads would be clear

i urge you all to work to better tailor

this system not only to reduce peak time

congestion but to consider further

measures to reduce private vehicle

traffic especially by addressing traffic

that does not cross into the cbd

instead of a border-centric system like

the one proposed we should be exploring

systems that take cars off of the road

in the outer berms as well

no area of this city that is well served

by public transit should be free to

drive

the citizens of manhattan are not the

only ones who deserve to enjoy reduced

congestion thank you

===

hi thanks for having me uh my name is

laura shepherd i'm a lifelong beans

resident and i'm here to emphatically

support implementing congestion pricing

now we shouldn't have to wait 16 months

to address the obvious persistent

unacceptable undignified conditions

those of us who walk bike and ride

transit put up with every day the

majority of new york city's city

residents do not own cars but our health

safety and quality of life suffers

greatly thanks to the minority who drive

here traffic violence is increasing our

air quality is poor and our buses are

slow and unreliable drivers also

disproportionately contribute to the

climate crisis and we cannot afford to

delay action i currently live in

woodside queens where i primarily rely

on my bike to get around cycling is

convenient affordable and healthy but it

needs to be safer too many cyclists are

injured and killed by drivers and too

many people are deterred from cycling

because of the danger and lack of a

connected protected bike network

throughout the city we need to reclaim

space that is currently inefficiently

occupied by drivers to build this

network i've been doored in the cbd

harassed and threatened by drivers and

frequently encountered drivers blocking

and encroaching on routes designated for

safe bike travel walking in the cbd is

also stressful and miserable due to

vehicle congestion blocked sidewalks and

crosswalks too many mid-block driveways

honking and fumes our transit system

desperately needs upgrades increased

capacity and full accessibility we need

to raise the money to expand the subways

throughout eastern queens as was planned

in 1938 build in phil long island

railroad stations and adopt permanent

city ticket pricing to aid the people

with some of the longest and most

arduous commutes in the city i know this

well because i grew up in oakland

gardens in eastern queens when we lost

the q75 bus to the mta service cuts of

2010 the length of my walks to other bus

routes doubled that same summer i had a

major medical operation at a manhattan

hospital eight days later i was

discharged during rush hour i am still

traumatized by the nearly two hours i

had to spend in traffic on the lie to

get home i would have paid a hundred

dollars that day to get the vehicles of

the able drivers who have alternatives

out of the way

i've relied on express buses trains and

buses to get to follow-up appointments

and procedures for the last 11 years i

cannot drive because i don't have full

range of motion in my right foot and

relying on cabs or for hire vehicles is

prohibitively expensive people with

disabilities are not a monolith and need

a range of options and accommodate which

every uber driver on the road negatively

impacts the majority of us they also

delay emergency vehicles and truck

deliveries please do not grant

additional exemptions which will water

down the tolling program and don't wait

16 months to make our city work for us

===

all right

yes my audio is working

yes sir

all right uh good uh good morning

everybody my name is john de luper i'm

from brooklyn i'm

speaking in support of the new tolling

program

uh hurricane ida showed us a lot of

infrastructure problems in our subways

and for increased resiliency we need new

sources of funds to allow the mta to

modernize its infrastructure and expand

its services

when i'm in manhattan in the central

business district i always try to take

mass transit and i've only taken cars

when absolutely necessary because cars

are so choked by the volume of traffic

we need to get solutions to traffic like

this program implemented immediately

also i want to add that uh just before

the pandemic i had an experience where i

had a business meeting in the city uh

from four to six pm right in the height

of rush hour and despite being on the

ninth floor the constant horn honking

was incredibly frustrating and made our

meeting very hard to conduct

so in terms of noise is a quality of

life issue that congestion pricing could

help address i i think that that is

definitely something we need and we need

to be trying so uh we need to be doing

something about the traffic in the

central business district congestion

pricing has worked in pure cities like

london for nearly 20 years so i'm hoping

we can get this going as soon as

possible so people who do need to drive

to the cbd are not stuck behind those

who aren't and new york

quality of life uh isn't being

deteriorated by car congestion thank you

===

all right can everyone hear me is this

working

yes we can okay great thanks um

thank you so much for holding this event

and inviting us to speak my name is

jordan fraud and i'm a brooklyn resident

um

i get around the city by pretty much

every

means of transit you can imagine i'm a

frequent subway rider i walk i ride my

bike uh my wife and i own a car that we

use occasionally

um and i am a strong supporter of

congestion pricing i

you know have been waiting for this

moment for more than a decade i was

disappointed when congestion pricing

failed in 2008 um and want to strongly

encourage you to move forward with this

process as quickly as possible

um

what we have right now in new york city

is a transit system that does not work

for every for anyone really we have a

subway system that is held together by

duct tape

um and is going to get worse because of

extreme weather it's not accessible to

people with disabilities

we have streets that are dangerous for

pedestrians and cyclists and are

becoming even more so since the pandemic

and if you're a driver you basically are

just sitting in traffic forever

miserable and frustrated uh what

congestion pricing can do is take this

system that does not work for anybody

and change the incentives so that

everyone gets a little bit something

right transit riders get more funds so

that the systems are more accessible

uh pedestrians and cyclists get more

street space that uh you know used by

the you know more street space caused by

fewer cars on the road so that we can

build more infrastructure for them and

drivers get a smoother and faster ride

um

it's basically a win-win for everyone uh

there's evidence from every city that

has ever tried it that it works really

well i just want to strongly encourage

you to not provide exemptions for the

personal vehicles of nypd police or

other city or state employees people

with parking placards on their

professional on their personal cars

should not be exempt from a congestion

pricing charge thanks very much

===

good morning i'm sherry diamond the

district director for congresswoman

nicole malliotakas

representing staten island and southern

brooklyn communities that are both

extremely sensitive to tolling

congresswoman malliotakis introduced h.r.

3715

the protection against double tolling

act legislation that would require the

mta to give the individuals who must pay

an existing toll to connect to the rest

of the city in which they live as staten

islanders must do a credit towards any

congestion pricing fee should new york

city move forward with its planned

congestion pricing program

congresswoman malliotakis has stated

that congestion pricing may have a

number of unintended consequences on new

york city residents commuters and

working class americans especially

during this period of economic recovery

at a time when americans are

experiencing inflation labor shortages

higher energy costs and costlier

consumer goods the last thing the mayor

and the governor should be doing is

implementing more taxation

congresswoman malia takas's

would ensure that residents of staten

island who already pay a toll to connect

to the rest of the city will have that

amount credited from the congestion fee

to prevent them from being double-headed

congresswoman malliotakis's goal is to

slow this program down or perhaps even

stop it altogether but if the congestion

pricing program does get final approval

i will again say that at a minimum the

congresswoman wants protections in place

for the residents of staten island to

ensure that they are never double tolled

thank you

==

um good morning thank you for the

opportunity to testify today in support

of implementing congestion pricing i am

danielle brecker i live in the dutch

kills neighborhood that bridges long

island city and astoria in queens the

seven nwre

are all nearby but yet my neighbors and

i are often delayed late for work school

doctor appointments job interviews

social events and more costing us all

time and money

the delays are almost always a result of

rain or other climate conditions or

malfunctioning signals the signals that

control our subway are based on 1930s

technology and cause train delays on

most days everyone who takes the subway

has been affected by signal delays

countless times our subway system needs

to be much more resilient to climate

change ida was a strong storm i've never

seen rain that heavy or that fast not

even during sandy but while ida may have

been one of the strongest storms it is

far from the first storm to flood

overwhelm and shutter our subway

it must be the last we need congestion

pricing and we need it now it will raise

at least 15 billion dollars to fix and

modernize our subway this will help fund

the mta's fast forward plan to make the

subway reliable and accessible the plan

includes upgrades to modernize the

signal system make more than 50 stations

accessible and deliver critical

improvements to our station completely

cars congestion pricing will have an

overwhelmingly positive environmental

impact by clearing the air of vehicle

exhaust and investing in cleaner

transportation our subway has always

been integral to our city and now it is

integral to our recovery combating

climate the climate crisis and our

future congestion pricing is integral to

keeping our subway moving thank you

my name is tiffany ann taylor and i'm

the vice president for transportation

for the regional plan association a

nearly 100 year old civic organization

working toward better mobility economic

opportunity affordable housing and a

more resilient new york city

metropolitan region

for decades we have strongly supported

congestion pricing because we think it

is a centerpiece of a set of policies

that will lead to a freedom more

equitable region congestion pricing will

reduce traffic congestion our estimates

show this program will decrease delay of

traffic by about 15 during busy periods

traffic levels are already surpassing

pre-coped levels so managing traffic is

key to our economic recovery congestion

pricing will raise vital revenue for

public transit the program will raise

115 billion in revenue and 100 of this

net revenue will go into paying for

improvements to our public

transportation system

congestion pricing will make the

transportation system more equitable the

majority of households in new york city

do not own cars and on average

households with cars have an income that

is nearly double those without we

produced a thorough report in 2019 that

analyzed a number of toll scenarios and

laid out recommendations for

implementation it is available for all

to read on our website at rpa.org key

recommendations from the report are as

follows implement transit and bicycle

improvements prior to starting

congestion pricing adopt specific

objectives and metrics to meet traffic

environmental and health goals and

ensure that benefits are equally shared

create a consistent toll rate for all

similar trips by providing total credits

to drivers and mta crossings to reduce

traffic for the cheapest souls we have

found that 25 of the am peak of traffic

on bqe is avoided during tolls on the

hugh carey tunnel to take advantage of

the free east river bridges introduce to

a tolling in the congestion zone and

vary the congestion fee by the level of

congestion at different times of day by

size of vehicle the mta should

incorporate these recommendations and

also analyze localized traffic impacts

in neighborhoods like washington heights

hybrids mott haven inwood along with

jersey city hoboken union city and fort

lee and new jersey thank you

===

hello my name is stephen bodson i live

in western queens

i'm here to complain about congestion

pricing i'm here to complain that it is

taking too long

the latest delays are being justified by

what the national environmental policy

act right

congestion pricing is obviously positive

for the environment it should be

improved with minimal review what's

causing environmental impact right now

is this review

this review is abetting politicians who

are just scared of doing anything about

traffic

this time-consuming process is delaying

the project and hurting the environment

i appreciate the emphasis on

environmental justice that's admirable

but it's ignoring the extra damage that

the delay causes to neighborhoods like

mine which are extraordinarily affected

by vehicle violence and pollution

congestion pricing as you've heard

plenty of times already today it will

help the region's air quality water

quality also safety from vehicular

violence it's going to provide income to

the mta

and reduce new york's contribution to

climate change

every day of delay has serious

environmental impacts

so i urge you to one

accelerate this review and two implement

congestion pricing as quickly as

possible thank you very much

thank you

our next speaker is tony malone followed

by benjamin turner

hi i'm tony malone and i live in

brooklyn

first i wanted to note that the two

assembly members and the member of

congress who spoke here against

congestion pricing didn't once mention

climate change we can't keep ignoring

the fact that climate change is going to

alter every aspect of life in new york

city

we need to transform our transportation

infrastructure so that every resident

can get around the city without adding

more pollution

a successful response to climate change

means getting people out of cars

congestion pricing is a great start and

it shouldn't take another 18 months for

us to implement a basic idea that has

already worked in other cities

it's important to remember that most new

york city households don't own a car as

other speakers have mentioned

and that those that do own a car have

almost twice the median income as those

who don't

low-income communities will benefit the

most from improving our subways buses

and other mass transit options we also

need to make our streets safer for

bicycles and pedestrians those are the

least expensive and least polluting

modes of transportation

i urge you not to give any exemptions to

city employees and those with

connections in local government

every day i see cars with placards or

vests on their dashboard parked in

pedestrian plazas and sidewalks around

brooklyn borough hall right next to

eight subway lines

government workers should be encouraged

to use transit like everyone else we're

all in this together finally i hope you

will consider this as just the start if

we're going to survive climate change we

need to keep implementing new policies

every year to discourage car use we also

need to keep offering better

transportation options throughout the

city

tolls and congestion charges should

increase yearly to reflect the true cost

of car dependency on our future climate

i hope that five years from now no one

would choose to commute regularly by car

in central new york city

thank you

===

hi there my name is ben turner and um

i'm i'd like to speak in in favor of of

congestion pricing i think it's long

overdue

uh look we all know it we can all see it

traffic auto traffic in new york city is

out of control

it's

take a look at any freeway around the

city uh during rush hour or even non

non-rush hours

most of them are congested with traffic

barely moving

but

sidewalks are

crosswalks are blocked sidewalks are

blocked in many cases

auto traffic is making the city

unlivable

and it's having the biggest impact on

middle and working class new yorkers

uh

assemblyman weapon spoke earlier and

claimed to speak for

middle class new yorkers

that's not who drives into manhattan

it's wealthier new yorkers there's

overwhelming evidence for that

and there's overwhelming evidence that

it's a choice that it's not a necessity

and it's luxury for well wealthy new

yorkers to be able to drive here

the city needs to do something about

climate change uh freeing up road space

and reorg

orienting it away from

vehicles for parking space will allow

more green space to absorb flooding

which is going to be likely in the area

in the era of

increased uh severe weather events

so the fewer

exemptions the better and i hope the

city and state also explore expanding it

in new areas like downtown flushing

where it takes half an hour to get by

bus from my neighborhood and bayside

into downtown flushing for the subway

solely because of auto

traffic please support climate change or

support congestion pricing it's a

necessary step in the city's future

thank you

===

um i wanted to speak in support of

congestion pricing i'll just make a few

points these have i think all been made

by others uh first is that this isn't

new

london does it and it works there we

should have done this many years ago the

second one is that it's fair car owners

are a minority and car owners are

generally wealthier than non-car owners

in this city we pay to get on the subway

we pay to get on the bus

we should be requiring payment from

drivers who want to get into the central

business district this will also benefit

drivers i'm sure everybody is familiar

with the experience of being stuck in

traffic in manhattan it is horrible the

status quo is not working and this may

assist in that

in general

driving is bad for the environment and

it is dangerous a few weeks ago

three-month-old baby was killed in

brooklyn by a car this is a

three-month-old baby

so

it becomes personal

that's all i'll say i think we should

implement this in a more aggressive

timeline another 16 months aren't

necessary to find out if it's

environmental to tall cars of course

it's environmental to toll cars what's

unenvironmental is not towing cars thank

you

===

hi my name is angel i'm a i live in

southern brooklyn i just wanted to speak

in support of congestion pricing the

area of manhattan below 60th street is

some of the most transit dense area in

the entire country it has access to four

commuter railroads

every subway line stops there with the

exception of one and every express bus

from the outer boroughs also stops at

some point in that area so there's

really no reason that anyone would

choose to drive into that

part of manhattan unless you are wealthy

enough to then make that choice for

yourself we all know that less than half

of the city owns cars and even a smaller

percentage of those people that own cars

then choose to use their cars to commute

into manhattan so we're talking about

wealthy people that are making that

choice and even in underserved

neighborhoods the people that own cars

in those underserved neighborhoods are

still wealthier than the folks that are

using transit and taking two or three

buses to then get to the subway i would

love to see an expansion of the city

ticket system especially in portions of

eastern queens as well as uh eastern

brooklyn as well so folks that are far

away from uh the subway but closer to an

lirr station can take advantage of that

and i would also encourage the mta to

not grant any exemptions especially for

municipal employees talking about police

officers firefighters that drive in from

long island and other parts outside of

the city and then park their cars

illegally on sidewalks in bus lanes in

bike lanes and create havoc for cyclists

pedestrians and other people that live

here

and lastly i would also hope that the

mta then uses funds to create more

accessible stations build more elevators

and ramps and stations to uh

it should be as accessible as possible

because we also know most

folks with disabilities use transit they

don't actually drive their cars all over

the place thank you

===

yes hello

can you hear me yes we can

yeah i got kicked off for some reason so

thanks for this opportunity my name is

chris hayward i live in brooklyn and

work in the cbd

most days i commute from park slope to

the flatiron district via bicycle

i am strongly in favor of congestion

pricing for many reasons first and

foremost is safety statistically drivers

are the biggest threat to my children's

lives as a cyclist i literally risk my

life every time i travel to or from my

workplace in the cbd

the extreme congestion in the cbd makes

the streets very dangerous for

pedestrians cyclists and drivers alike

as it leads to increased driver

aggression and creates especially unsafe

conditions including blocked crosswalks

and bike lanes

congestion pricing will reduce the

volume of cars traveling through the cbd

and the streets safer for all second the

heavy congestion results in high

pollution which i and other pedestrians

and cyclists are forced to breathe

congestion also results in excessive

noise pollution from drivers pointlessly

honking their horns when stuck in

traffic

third congestion handicaps bus services

which

disproportionately harms low-income new

yorkers

fourth the revenue that congestion

pricing will generate is sorely needed

to improve our public transit system

which is frankly a joke compared to

those in most european cities in terms

of reliability speed and comfort and it

can be very much improved with the

revenue that congestion pricing will

generate

there are many other reasons i

support congestion pricing but time is

limited i hope that the toll reflects

the true externalities associated with

driving to manhattan even the high end

of 23 dollars quoted at the beginning of

this call is too low congestion pricing

has been demonstrated to be very

successful in major cities such as

london would have similar positive

effects here i also hope that in the

future the congestion pricing zone has

expanded well beyond the cbd as many

other parts of the city would benefit

from congestion pricing and i would like

to see a less man manhattan centric plan

thank you

===

yes we can hear you

okay

thank you for hearing my testimony today

i'm a resident of southeastern queens

for six years

and i voiced my strong support of a

robust congestion pricing program in new

york city as quickly as possible the

central business district tolling

program will have ultra-positive

environmental physical

and mental impacts by reducing motor

vehicle congestion clearing the air of

excessive emissions

and raising funds that will be invested

in delivering cleaner and faster

transportation for millions of people

a lot of us commute to work in manhattan

you got both long inconsistent

inaccessible commutes on the subway and

bus and slow moving traffic and

frustration with parking

the goal of funding transit improvements

is to make it more feasible for drivers

to switch to transit

making it easier for the remaining

drivers who really need four wheels

being low income myself i'm actually in

front of a library right now trying to

get good wi-fi without disturbing anyone

else

transit fares might be expensive but the

congestion toll is nothing compared to

the full cost of a car that are

exorbitantly out of reach in the first

place

transit and cycling are the only

legitimately affordable mobility and

there's no cbd surcharge with these

methods but also i don't want to drive

it seems very stressful and mentally

unhealthy between other mad drivers your

responsibility to not injure or kill

other street users

and knowing you're contributing to the

traffic you want to get rid of and to

climate change

there are others like me who don't drive

most households in the city don't own a

car students go students go to school by

bus etc so congestion pricing is in our

interest to serve many locals and it's

not the poor people regression or tax

many are saying it is

thank you very much once again

you

===

thank you and thank you for the

opportunity to speak my name is sandra

voss and i'm a resident of the bronx i'm

a strong supporter of congestion pricing

the issue of prioritizing people over

cars in our city is one that is close to

my heart as my brother-in-law was killed

by a driver last year while riding his

bike outside of boston

we are facing a traffic violence

epidemic in nyc with a 30 percent jump

in traffic related fatalities between

june 2020 and july 2021

reducing the number of cars in new york

city will help to reduce traffic

violence

even setting aside the issue of traffic

violence new york has never been a city

for driving

according to 2018 census estimates the

majority of nyc households did not own a

car including 60 percent of bronx

households most of us therefore get

around by subway bus walking or biking

anyone who regularly uses these modes of

transportation is aware that they are

all in need of increased funding and

infrastructure which will both be

achieved through the revenue generated

from the congestion pricing plan

the more we continue to cater to drivers

in our city the more our buses and

emergency vehicles will continue to be

slowed by traffic and the more our

transit system will continue to be

plagued by delays and outdated systems

some opponents of the plan have

suggested that residents of the outer

boroughs will be negatively impacted

because they lack good transit options

but the answer to this problem is not to

continue to rely on cars to fill the

gaps in transit the answer is to improve

transit and reduce reliance on cars

furthermore given the climate crisis

which disproportionately affects

low-income communities

there is no excuse for continuing to

allow so many cars to clog our streets

and pollute our air cities around the

globe like paris are taking impressive

steps to reduce the number of cars and

prioritize transit biking and walking it

will be a global embarrassment if new

york city does not act to implement

congestion pricing as soon as possible

thank you

===

good morning i am felicia park rogers

and i'm the director of regional

infrastructure projects for tri-state

transportation campaign an advocacy and

policy organization fighting for

sustainable mobility in new york new

jersey and connecticut

we strongly support the implementation

of congestion pricing we have always

understood that congestion pricing is

not simply about the tolling system but

about the toll that traffic congestion

and air pollution exacts on the

livability of our city and the health

and well-being of our most vulnerable

communities both in new york city and

throughout the region

new york must rise to the challenge of

significantly scaling back greenhouse

gas emissions to achieve an 85 percent

reduction and 100 net zero carbon

emission economy by 2050. this goal

requires a rapid reshaping of the

economy and how we view the urban

environment as one of the most climate

vulnerable and diverse coastal cities

new york city must lead the way for

major cities nationally and around the

world

since the devastating impact of super

storm sandy in 2012 we have been at the

front line of the crime climate crisis

that will continue to negatively impact

the entire city torrential downpours and

flash flooding like what we saw in

recent weeks are expected to occur more

frequently and become even more severe

we must act now to reduce carbon

emissions from the transportation sector

and this starts with implementing

congestion pricing not only is this a

win for the environment and for public

health it's also a win for millions of

transit riders who rely on a transit

system that needs new revenue streams to

fund its multi-billion dollar capital

campaign

within the 30 counties that make up the

project study area 52 are residents of

color and 13

of residents have household incomes

below the poverty line according to the

mta the vast majority of commuters into

manhattan's cbd reach their destination

by public transit and low-income people

represent the largest share of

public transit readers riders in new

york city i'm almost done while

congestion pricing by itself won't solve

every transportation challenge our city

faces it is an integral part of a larger

strategy tri-state has been fighting for

congestion pricing for well over a

decade and now is the time thank you

===

all right can you all hear me

yes we can okay good afternoon everyone

i'm bradley beshear's planning manager

at the permanent citizens advisory

committee to the mta pcac

i'm also an avid runner from queens

where i begin my day early alongside

increasing car traffic heading into

manhattan's core making my run even more

difficult and dangerous

as i continue to play roulette with cars

every morning i

the more i realize the need for

congestion pricing now more than ever

congestion pricing is the only feasible

way to substantially raise funds for the

mta without raising or fares bringing in

a steady stream of money for key

improvements for the region's transit

system

especially in the wake of low ridership

thanks to kova 19 and worsening climate

change the billions of dollars that

congestion pricing will bring could not

be more important for riders across the

system

particularly relevant this climate week

the environmental benefits of congestion

pricing cannot be understated as we

tragically learn from historic storms

and flooding this summer the mta needs

infrastructure funding as it's faced

with the herculean task of building a

resilient regional transit system that

can withstand the forces of extreme

weather we already know that efficient

reliable transit is the way to get

drivers out of their cars congestion

pricing will bring the billions of

dollars we need to repair our transit

while also improving air quality

decreasing traffic around the five

boroughs and making new york a less car

dependent city

outer borough residents have infinite

reasons to be excited about congestion

pricing thousands of essential projects

and jobs rely on the 15 billion it will

bring in when bonded including

modernizing signals on 13 subway lines

building new elevators and more than 44

stations adding thousands of new buses

and train cars repairing century old

infrastructure and expanding bus service

constant bumper-to-bumper traffic can be

a thing of the past bringing a better

quality of life and faster bus commutes

to communities not just in the cbd but

all over the city

riders deserve reliable and frequent

service across our subways buses and

commuter realm finally thanks to

congestion pricing the 21st century

transit system new yorkers desperately

need 

===

i live in queens and i work in kearney

new jersey uh this congestion pricing

would double my miles to get there to

avoid the congestion pricing that double

miles basically translates to double my

pollution that would be same thing for

anybody else that was made in your

presentation earlier uh people trying to

avoid going through manhattan because

they need to get to brooklyn from new

jersey or whatever direction

so basically what i foresee is a circle

of smog an increase in pollution in the

whole area because of this

the other thing is why can't we just use

parking is the equalizer

basically if you do decrease congestion

these parking lots are going to go out

of business and so has anybody

considered that environmental impact

and also with uber

let's try to follow the money why are

they putting so much money into

this congestion pricing i'm really

wondering what's going on here uh then

finally

the people that are attacking the police

in this conversation i wish you'd stop

doing that the police do protect us and

they are the people that are important

to me thank you

===

i'm a resident of the east bronx i'm a

subway rider an express bus rider a

cyclist and a pedestrian i'm urging for

the swift implementation of the central

business district tolling program with

minimal exemptions

driving to the central business district

is a choice that far too many people are

taking for trips that are almost always

better accomplished by public transit

the congestion on our streets threaten

the health and safety of the vast

majority of new yorkers who make the

right choice those who walk take transit

and bike to their destinations

it is a choice i'm originally from the

eastern edge of queens and even though i

lived more than three miles away from

the subway terminal in a so-called

transit desert that was never an excuse

to take a car into manhattan i took the

bus and subway daily to get to manhattan

with a small percentage of folks who

actually need to drive to the central

business district the congestion on our

streets isn't working for them either

let's make the choice easier we need to

do everything in the toolbox to

discourage driving and congestion

pricing is a very effective tool we must

utilize we have to speed up this process

because we should have had this program

a decade ago

we should also have minimal exemptions

and cutouts to reduce the abuse of such

exemptions we already see too much

corruption in the form of placard abuse

the motorcycle exemption sounds okay but

otherwise let's not water this down

thank you

===

okay and you cut my video okay um

good morning thank you for the

opportunity to speak my name is neil

weissman i head up complete george 200

organizations communities and public

officials calling for wider bikeways

across the george washington bridge i

just posted a link in the q a

um

yeah all right i just i posted a link in

the q a i bring here attention a

proposal for new york city d.o.t and

parks to designate 500 miles of urban

bikeways this network would reduce

resident cost of travel extend access to

green space and provide numerous

opportunities for exercise and

recreation consistent with the goals of

the towing program it would mitigate

congestion improve air quality bridge

transport deserts and facilitate

multimodal trips in the outer boroughs

in tokyo a city of 13 million where 90

percent commute by mass transit one

third bike the first and last mile

this network would harden up transport

grid against widespread outage in the

days following super storm sandy bike

traffic across east river bridges surged

from 13 000 per day to 30 000

and making it easier to making it easier

and safer to bike is our most cost

effective tool to reduce greenhouse

emissions from transport

a key impediment to the scheme however

are mta 7 toll bridges which are ideally

placed to facilitate bike travel to the

outer boroughs but do not currently

support cycling therefore i call on the

mta to embrace the biagi gonzalez rojas

bikes on bridge advisory board and to

allocate the resources needed to affect

their recommendations

thank you

===

my name is lucia deng and i live in the

bronx i live in one of the outer

boroughs that

some of your commenters have been saying

are going to be

unfairly impacted by this congestion

pricing toll i just wanted to say that i

completely disagree

and i think that folks in the outer

boroughs are going to be

um

really happy to have increased

funding directed at transit

improving our

buses and subways

you know in my neighborhood in the bronx

almost 90 percent of the residents do

not drive to work so when people say

comments such as oh well this toll is

going to

unfairly impact

the poor folks that's just completely

disingenuous

the vast majority of people

who live in the bronx actually do

commute via buses and trains and other

modes and not cars so um you know we

really need to speed up the approval

process for this

it's just going to benefit everyone and

we need to really shift the incentives

in the city away from using personal

vehicles away from being able to store

cars on the street taking up valuable

space for free

it's about time that drivers

and and car owners pay their fair share

thanks everyone

===

there we go hi everyone my name is alexa

jacob and i am currently a student um i

study at the cooper union in manhattan

which is with the cbd i also live in

queens um so i've been taking the subway

to school ever since our new semester

started um and i would really love to

bike i love biking i bike all over the

city but the thing is biking in new york

city kind of sucks

um whenever i bike in lower manhattan uh

cars always get angry at me i stay in

the bike lane i wear my helmet i do all

the stops i am like a very good cyclist

but

cars are just like violent towards me um

and that's something that i think we

could change if we implement pedestrian

pricing because driving makes you angry

especially when there's traffic um

and that kind of anger leads to road

rage and recently traffic violence and

that hurts people so congestion pricing

i think is really necessary because i

want to be able to bike to school i want

to feel safe doing so and that is

something that congestion pricing could

help something i also care a lot about

is climate change you know i'm a student

i'm pretty young i have my whole life

ahead of me except for climate change

it's gonna ruin that so let's not ruin

that um i think that new york city could

be a much more climate forward city if

we get rid of our dependence on cars and

if we incentivize other forms of

transportation some people are saying

that it's gonna disadvantage people who

are getting double told

first off the staten island theory is

free um you guys have a free way to get

off the island um but also like

i think it's fine disadvantaged people

who are causing climate chaos

and we should advantage people who are

not

um

and they like as a lot of other people

have said um

drivers need to pay their fair share i

love passing cars in manhattan because

they're always stuck in gridlock but

then they get angry at me and that's bad

so let's just have more condition

pricing sooner thank you

===

hey uh hello and thank you

for holding this my name is pedro

rodriguez and i lived in new york city

for about 20 years now i grew up in the

bronx i now live in central queens i'm a

walker a transect taker a new driver i

got my license and bought a car doing

the pandemic so i'm one of those

one of those

and i now have a bike due to uh the new

bike lanes that keep expanding

everywhere

we need congestion pricing uh pollution

from smoke tires noise makes new york

city a place that's hostile to raising a

family something that i want to do

this kind of pollution leads to ask my

kids the noise makes putting a kid down

to sleep impossible

is it any wonder that when people uh

people come to new york city they make a

bunch of money and then they live

leaving immediately they want to make a

family that's something they're able to

to leave i know it's no wonder it is a

hostile city to raise a family in

new york city is one of the few places

in the united states where you are where

you don't need to have a car and this

increases child independence which

studies have shown have a great effect

on the child's mental development

studies have also shown that it has a

great effect in the parents

mental stress because it gives them more

free time i mean

just just think about how much time a

parent gets

back if they don't need to chaperone

their kids around until the age of 16 or

18 in some places uh but this is this

independence this child independence is

being stifled by traffic pollution noise

and general car hazards like block

sidewalks and and reckless drivers and

although congestion pricing is only

gonna happen in manhattan it's gonna

affect everywhere due to uh induced

demand i would prefer uh new york city

to have a bigger congestion pricing

uh than what we have right now

especially around all the denser places

in new york city not just manhattan

congestion pricing is going to help turn

your city from a place where people come

to make money and they move out once

they want to have a family to a place

where families want to come here and

thrive in so they can have healthy

independent children so please implement

congestion pricing as soon as possible

thank you

===

how you doing my name is jose hernandez

i am the president of the new york city

chapter of united spinal association i'm

also a person with a physical disability

i am not against um the

central

central business district tolling

program

however um as a person who does a lot of

business in the central business and a

person with a disability that drives a

wheelchair accessible minivan

i believe that there should be an

exemption for individuals who have the

parking permit for people with physical

disabilities as i

work with the mayor's office for people

with disabilities i'm also one of the

commissioners of the civic engagement

commission and we host meetings in city

hall or whenever i'm advocating at 250

broadway and i need to get down there as

we know that the mta doesn't have a lot

of accessibility and getting around the

city is very difficult for people with

disabilities

but with that being said i do support it

because it will increase this

accessibility but

you know we need to make sure that

individuals who with disabilities who do

drive can get around um easily and are

exempt from the

new tool

thank you

===

sorry i was muted there good afternoon

my name is eric mcclure on behalf of

streets pack a political action

committee and advocacy organization

dedicated to improving public transit

and making city streets safer i'm here

today to urge the speedy and complete

adoption of the central business

district holding program

traffic congestion costs new yorkers

hundreds of hours and lost time and

productivity every year and in the

aggregate tens of billions of dollars in

lost economic activity new york city's

congestion is the worst in the nation

and that congestion underlies a heavy

environmental and health burden motor

vehicles stuck in gridlock pollute the

city's air and sickened its residents

and it's getting worse according to the

latest data traffic in new york city is

now at 115 percent of pre-pandemic

levels this is an untenable epically bad

situation that will only get worse

without decisive action

at the same time our public transit

system so essential to the city's

success and well-being suffers greatly

from under investment the current record

five-year capital plan for which funding

sources are still sketchy at best will

only just begin to address the system's

needs and represents a mere down payment

on the world class transit system new

yorkers deserve the central business

district polling program however will go

a long way toward addressing the dual

challenges of crushing congestion and

adequate capital funding similar efforts

in stockholm singapore and london have

markedly reduced congestion and sped up

travel times and the bonded revenue from

congestion pricing will yield a reliable

revenue stream of billions of dollars

for capital improvements the benefits of

faster commutes reduced air pollution

and upgraded transit service will endure

to those new yorkers who need the most

the working people who actually depend

on their cars for their livelihoods or a

reliable bus for subway commute to work

and the ej communities who for far too

long have borne the brunt of pollution

and the noise and danger from relentless

vehicle traffic the mta the governor and

the other responsible entities must move

expeditiously as possible to complete

the environmental assessment any work

that can be carried out simultaneously

such as installation of towing

coordinates and appointment of the

traffic mobility review board members

should proceed to pace congestion

pricing was approved two and a half

years ago and new yorkers can't wait an

equivalent amount of time for its

implementation our need for action is

immediate thank you
