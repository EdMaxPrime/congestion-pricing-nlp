good evening

i'm senator anna kaplan

and i want to take this time to thank

you for this opportunity

when we set out to enact congestion

pricing in 2019 we were trying to

address chronic problems impacting our

region

traffic

and lack of investment in our public

transit

unfortunately the pandemic has only

made these problems worse

and it is so

it is so much more important than ever

that we enact the program without delay

and that we enacted the right way

the promised 10 proceeds for the long

island railroad

estimated that 100 million per year will

allow for transformative investments to

take place in our local infrastructure

like the purchase of the new train cars

and overall improvements to service and

reliability for long island commuters

this money must be protected for long

island and must be used exclusively for

the benefit of long island railroad

riders

and i will not accept any program that

does not fulfill this promise

additionally in setting toll prices and

exemptions

there must be a regional fairness

if the program is going to be a success

there can be no preferences given to new

york city or new jersey residents that

aren't also given to the suburban long

island residents

carving out certain people from

responsibility

while shifting the burden to others is

unfair

and i will only support a program that

treats long island residents and

commuters fairly

this program stands to be a huge win for

our region

one billion dollars investment annually

in our mass transit and in our subways

and it will help

and it will help long island to finally

get the world-class railroad service

that it deserves thank you

===

hello are you able to hear me

yes

thank you i'm state senator todd

kaminsky and i appreciate this

opportunity and i echo so much of what

senator kaplan had said

long islanders have lost a great deal of

faith in the railroad they want to know

that

any funding is going to go to very

specific projects that will improve the

quality of their commutes in a very real

and material way for them and those need

to be laid out

and made clear

but it's also important that while the

whole point of congestion pricing is to

get people to ride the rails

until that is uh

is um we're way down the line on that

the tolling has to be fair it cannot be

so exorbitant uh that it crushes people

and at the same time you also have to

give people opportunities at different

times at less congested times to opt to

drive into the city then when the

pricing might not be as high and give

people those options and of course the

exemptions need to be

made fair so that we're not driving

people towards some roads and bridges

and tolls and not others

which could create massive traffic

problems and also lots of equity issues

with respect to unfairness

so please be reasonable in how you do

this please take long island voices into

consideration the cost of living here is

very high people uh consider moving all

the time because of that and adding um

some draconian fee to driving in the

city uh it would be very difficult for

for many to undertake and swallow and of

course having a double toll from taking

a bridge or tunnel in and a congestion

pricing fee

certainly does not seem fair and

should not be made in some places and

not others

so i hope we could invest in our public

transit system in a meaningful way it is

necessary for our region to work

but we need to do this smart well

thought out and reasoned and of course

done fairly please consider long island

voices when making this program

appreciate that thank you

===

eric yes hi

i'd like to thank everyone for taking

the time and hearing my voice

just to really start briefly i'm 25

years old born and raised in roslyn new

york on long island uh some of the best

memories that i've had are driving into

the city with my parents driving into

the city with my friends right when i

got my license at 17 18 years old

i never thought twice about it and why

would i

i'm always supposed to go into new york

city to have fun and be with my friends

and family of course i take the long

island railroad every day

pre-covid to commute to the office in

the city but with this congestion fee

that would inhibit me from doing that

why should i as a long islander have to

pay an additional fee to drive into new

york city to do what i love to do on top

of everything else such as the cost of

living in long island nassau county

which is always on the rise

i understand

why this program is being talked about

due to

the um economic burden that covid has

caused as well as environmental problems

but i ask that you reconsider this to

really

understand from a long islanders

perspective

what this means it's not necessarily

about the minimal fee that it is it's

what it stands for in principle

in conclusion i really thank you for

your time please

consider what long islanders will feel

take our emotions into consideration

um and i really appreciate it and as

i said

remember myself 25 year old who loves to

drive to new york city loves the

memories with friends family

traffic is always a problem but as new

yorkers we are known to be able to fight

through that

um and thank you for your time

thank you

===

good afternoon can you hear me clearly

yes

how are you everybody thanks for coming

i find that this is a complete and total

unacceptable use of our time and funds

this was crammed down our throat by a

corrupt governor who didn't care about

what he was doing or the people under

him or the safety or well-being of them

um we've had numerous bridges which have

been operating as derelict that i've had

the unfortunate have had to pray pray

that there's nothing goes wrong as we

drive over them we've priced people out

of using bridges to to nudge them along

to get them a little bit further down

the road and i have a vote of zero

confidence for the long island railroad

that has had 100 years to electrify 60

miles worth of track what we're not

doing it i refuse in any way shape or

form to allow somebody to send my data

track me to do

any of these things we've had

and to pay

a 90 percent vig to go to work or to

look for work because as an artist

that's been discriminated against in the

city by the city during the pandemic

we're at our wit's end

the the audacity of the

mta president to come on down and say go

back to broadway after we were told that

we're not allowed to go around and do

what we love and all these other things

it won't be uh it won't be tolerated you

know i'm gonna as a right now i'm

considering this public notice of 32

days for all of the people whom we're

here as elected officials and everything

if i find out that any of you have made

more than 20 off of any of these

companies that have been price gouging

us we're going to make sure that you

spend a day in federal court i've had to

watch my friend's art be crushed i've

had to and further my reserve the right

to drive all my drunk friends home

without having them to be screwed over

by uber and lyft another entity which

you guys have been using continuously as

a political pawn these people has been

suicides over work people getting fired

people afraid to go to the department of

labor because they're afraid ice is

waiting there thank you and again we're

not paying for this have a wonderful day

===

uh yes how you doing can you hear me

yes um i i have no comments i would just

like to listen to other feedback you can

go ahead and um move to the next

participant thank you

thank you

===
how can you see and hear me

yes

hi great good evening my name is lisa

dagley and i'm the executive director of

the permanent citizens advisory

committee to the mta ccap

regularly here on the top branch the lirr

gets me where i need to go but

infrastructure and signal upgrades are

essential to speeding up the truck

congestion pricing is the way to make

that happen

recent historic storms and flooding have

tested our rail infrastructure but with

service restored by the following day

we've seen the resiliency of the lirr we

have to make sure we're prepared to face

worsening extreme weather by funding

critical infrastructure improvements

around the region

congestion pricing will help us avoid a

grim reality for the mta's future

without a long-term strategy it's like

industrial pricing every day commuter

rail subway bus riders will take the hit

the billion dollars bonded to 15 billion

dollars brought in by congestion pricing

are more than just crucial

they will be the lifeblood of the entire

new york city metropolitan area and the

jobs that they bring in

commuters have a ton of questions about

congestion pricing what will the tolls

cost will drivers be charged for a trip

or per day what will traffic look at

like outside the zone who will be exempt

we understand that getting answers is

part of the environmental assessment and

subsequent deliberations of the traffic

mobility review board and expect those

meetings to be held in public

but even with the unknown we're certain

that congestion pricing is is the future

of long island and the long island

railroad projects like repairing and

making more stations ada accessible

third track and eastside access

and critical track signal and power

upgrades will help ensure that long

islanders have safe reliable efficient

service

congestion pricing a few exemptions is

the only feasible way to raise funds for

central improvements with long island

railroad it's the best way to make sure

that fair discounts and flexible fare

options are possible bringing more

riders to the commuter rail system by

making it more affordable we've seen how

similar air reduction options work

successfully in new jersey and beyond

taking the railroad into the city isn't

just good for the environment

yes congestion pricing can make it even

better

thank you

===

good evening do you hear me

yes

okay

uh

my name is susan solo and i live in the

five towns

for years i've been using the long

island railroad to commute from rosedale

queens to penn station manhattan

and i walked to my employer which is on

first avenue on east 23rd street

tonight i wanted to share why i fully

support the proposal to implement the

central business district tolling no

exception or carved outs new york has

led the work in delivery reliable

service for commuters in your city and

surrounding counties however the quality

of the service is dropping while other

major cities are investing heavily in

transit

new york cities always are moving people

all over the moving millions of people

who are the workforce

of the city students and tourists

without the use of the car

however this past month september this

month the trains are using

very old technology that was developed

way back in the 30s

now many of the stations are not even

accessible for the handicaps

even though that the law has been

implemented in many other cities

new york needs to be a fair city and it

needs to do better

to improve access to everyone

i walk every day

from penn station to 23rd street

and the roads are getting more dangerous

for me

the city by riders are actually using

the sidewalks because they're afraid of

the cars

i see how the pedestrian

and myself we are concerned about the

high volume of cars

we need to promote better mode of

transportation

into the city we need to improve the bus

the solar waste and the trains we also

need to promote

more bicycles the solution is simple we

need to reduce reduce the congestion

similar proposals have been used in

other areas and your needs to do better

thank you 

===

hi can you hear me

yes

hi good evening everybody my name is

matt camper

i am a long island resident um for over

26 years and i'm here tonight to talk

about congestion pricing

congestion pricing is a thing that has

been talked about for

many years

and as a resident

as a commuter on the long island

railroad i've seen the congestion first

hand

um along the l.i.e people trying to get

from long island

who may need to drive into manhattan

congestion is

absolutely

worse than ever and i completely for

that reason support congestion pricing

we need to reduce the congestion across

this region we need to reduce the

congestion of people trying to drive

into manhattan and encourage riders to

get back onto mass transit where they

belong because

it's going to help

for emergency personnel it's going to

help for the first responders who have

helped us through this coven 19 pandemic

and as a resident i feel that we need to

reduce the congestion that is on the

roads throughout this region and for

those trying to drive into manhattan and

as far as the concerns that i've heard

throughout this process as far as the

resonance in manhattan i do also feel

that residents in manhattan do deserve

to get some kind of exemption for people

who live in manhattan because it would

not be fair to those residents if they

have to pay just

to park

in manhattan as a resident so i feel

they do absolutely need an exemption and

i hope that you guys can please consider

that as we go forward thank you so much

===

good evening my name is liam blank i'm

policy and communications manager for

tri-state transportation campaign which

is a 28-year-old advocacy and policy

organization fighting for sustainable

mobility in new york new jersey and

connecticut

we have always understood that

congestion pricing is not simply about

the tolling system but about the toll

that traffic congestion and air

pollution exacts on the livability of

our city and the health and well-being

of our most vulnerable communities

new york must rise to the challenge of

significantly scaling back greenhouse

gas emissions to achieve an 85 percent

reduction and a 100 percent net zero

carbon emission economy by 2050. this

goal requires a rapid reshaping of the

economy and how we view the urban

environment as one of the most climate

vulnerable and diverse coastal cities

new york city must lead the way for

major cities nationally and around the

world

since the devastating impact of

superstorm sandy in 2012 we have been at

the front line of the climate crisis

that will continue to negatively impact

the entire region torrential downpours

and flash flooding like what we have

seen in recent weeks are expected to

occur more frequently and become even

more severe we must act now to reduce

carbon emissions from the transportation

sector and this starts with implementing

congestion pricing not only is this a

win for the environment and public

health it's also a win for millions of

transit riders who rely on a transit

system that needs new revenue streams to

fund its multi-billion dollar capital

program

within 30 counties that make up the

project study area 52 percent of

residents are people of color and 13 of

residents have household incomes below

the poverty line according to the mta

the vast majority of commuters into

manhattan cbd reach their destination by

public transit and low income people

represent the largest share of public

transit riders in the city while

congestion pricing by itself won't solve

every transportation challenge our city

faces it's an integral part of our

larger strategy to make urban

transportation more efficient

sustainable and equitable tri-state has

been fighting for congestion pricing for

well over a decade and now it's finally

within reach we cannot afford to delay

any longer thank you

===

andrew yes can you hear me now

yes okay thank you let me just bring up

my uh

my statement if you'll give me a moment

i just lost it

uh

it's got to bring this down

okay then i'll just paraphrase what i

was going to say

my name is andrew sparberg i am a

62-year resident of

nassau county

i'm also a retired transportation

professional both from long island

railroad and from the

uh predecessor agency to nimtick

i'm now currently an adjunct faculty

member at the city university of new

york

uh the transportation demands of the

nassau queen suffolk carter have only

gone up if you look at a couple of

statistics you will see that

uh

from the last 40 years a number of

people who travel between this corridor

and manhattan south of 60th street has

gone up from over 650 000 in 1981 to

over 750 000 today

so the demand is there and yet the

subway capacity in queens has barely

increased in last in the last 80 years

long island railroad track

track capacity is only increasing now

because of the third track and the

and the grand central access it's

currently under construction so

congestion pricing in my professional

and personal opinion is needed and it's

time to implement it now it's very

important let's not look let's not lose

this opportunity

thank you

===

hello we can hear you yes thank you yes

um

thank you for this opportunity to

comment about the proposed congestion

pricing tolling program

um i think that many speakers here and

in other meetings have brought up many

good reasons that we need to implement

the congestion pricing with utmost

speed much faster than the 16 months

that's going to take too long there's

many reasons in terms of environment

greenhouse gas pollution

safety noise pollution um equity etc

that uh the congestion pricing should be

implemented

um i wanted to note here that i think

that the current plan is too manhattan

focused and that we actually should

consider congestion pricing that

encompasses the outer boroughs

specifically one of the reasons i'm

concerned is that i live in park slope

and i can imagine that people will drive

from long island and from other suburban

areas and use

mine in other neighborhoods as a park

and ride

in order to get into manhattan

and we already see many of the same

problems in my neighborhood that we see

in manhattan due to congestion one big

problem is we have many people from the

placard class so police and firefighters

for example city employees that drive in

from their homes in long island and they

decide that because they have placards

and they know that ny pd won't do

anything they park on the sidewalks uh

just this day on the walk to my kid's

school seven blocks from my apartment

many parents walking their kids to

school that right outside the fire

department there was a firefighter that

had his car parked in the middle of the

sidewalk and basically said to me what

are you gonna do about it the police

don't care these are the kind of people

that should be taking the train they

should not be driving into the city um

honking their horns blocking the

sidewalks putting my children and other

pedestrians and cyclists at risk so

please consider going even beyond just

manhattan and doing

congestion pricing that includes the

outer boroughs also thank you very much
